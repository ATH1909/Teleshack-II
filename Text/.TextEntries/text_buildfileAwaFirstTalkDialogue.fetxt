Hoo boy[Beat] looking for some extra[N]
bodies to toss on the pyre, eh?[N]
Hey, no need to get so prickly[AN]
about it! We both know we're[N]
fighting a losing battle here, and[N]
you need new mooks. No shame in that,[AN]
right? Look, take my advice; stick[N]
close to me, and you might just[N]
make it out of this mess alive.[AN]
When it comes to not dying, I'm[N]
prooobably the most skilled[N]
person on this whole island.[AN]
So[Beat] how about it?[A][X]
