## Longxia_Groto_C

[MidLeft][LoadLongxia][MidRight][LoadGroto]
[MidLeft]Hm? Lad, what's[N]
your name?[A]
[MidRight]Me Groto.[N]
Who is lady?[AN][CloseEyes]
[Beat][N]
Lady is Longxia?[A][OpenEyes]
[MidLeft][Beat] How did you know that?[N]
I may have an inflated sense[AN]
of my own self-worth,[N]
but small enough an ego to know[AN]
I ain't that famous.[N]
[MidRight][Beat] Groto have special power.[A]
[MidLeft]Yeah, and I'm the dark god, Cherne.[N]
Come on, don't be a dolt.[AN]
People don't just knows names of[N]
other folks without 'em saying it.[AN]
You been dropping eaves on my[N]
chats, haven't you?[AN]
[MidRight]Groto doesn't know drops[N]
and Groto doesn't know eaves.[AN]
I[Beat] my powers[Beat][N]
Never mind[Beat] I go[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Hm? Was that large man crying?[AN]
Longxia, your words pierce like the[N]
bill of a swordfish.[AN]
Should go apologize to the lad.[N]
[Beat] Maybe later, that is.[A][X]

## Longxia_Groto_B

[MidLeft][LoadLongxia][MidRight][LoadGroto]
[MidLeft]Ho! Groto![N]
Just a moment, lad![AN]
[MidRight]Groto forget lady's name.[N]
Groto leave her alone.[AN]
[MidLeft]Now that's even ruder than before.[N]
Come now, I came to apologize.[AN]
You said you had some kind of[N]
special[Beat] power?[AN]
What sort of power is it?[N]
You can guess peoples' names?[A]
[MidRight]Me[Beat] I[Beat][N]
It is hard to use words.[AN]
My brain can read others.[A]
[MidLeft]A mind reader, eh?[N]
How did you stumble upon that?[AN]
Never heard of any folk suddenly[N]
learning mindreading like one[AN]
would learn to cook shellfish[N]
or shoot a bow.[A]
[MidRight][CloseEyes][Beat] It was dark time for Groto.[N]
[OpenEyes]Groto cannot unsee it.[AN]
[MidLeft]Yeah, studying and all that ain't fun.[N]
But you can read minds.[AN]
Now that's a rare gift.[N]
A lucrative one, I wager.[AN]
How did you learn to do it?[N]
What's your secret, Groto?[AN]
[MidRight]Groto has no secret.[N]
Groto nothing to tell.[AN]
[MidLeft]Hmph, high and mighty, are we?[N]
Keeping your techniques close to the chest?[AN]
I suppose that's that, then.[N]
Farewell, Groto.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]Longxia's words are sad.[N]
But her mind is not.[AN]
What is Longxia scheming?[A][X]

## Longxia_Groto_A
[MidLeft][LoadLongxia][MidRight][LoadGroto]
Lady![A]
[MidLeft]Groto the Magnificent![N]
A man with such powerful mind.[AN]
He shan't dare tell his secret[N]
to the lowly ocean-dweller, Longxia.[A]
[MidRight]Groto technique[Beat][N]
It was not Groto's doing.[AN]
Groto[Beat][N]
given gift by strange man.[A]
[MidLeft]A gift? I don't need to read minds[N]
to know that ain't the truth![AN]
You're quivering thinking about it.[A]
[MidRight]Lady can see Groto's thoughts?[A]
[MidLeft]You tell me.[A]
[MidRight]Longxia cannot read Groto thoughts.[N]
Yet, Longxia knows how Groto feel.[A]
[MidLeft]Just look at you![N]
You talk like no one else I've ever heard.[AN]
Any time you bring up the origin[N]
of your so-called powers, you tremble.[AN]
I don't need to pry to know[N]
you've fell victim to something foul.[AN]
And in fact, I won't.[N]
Some things I'm better off not knowing.[AN]
I thought I'd trick you into teaching[N]
me this power of yours,[AN]
but I think it now to be unwise.[N]
Look at those eyes.[AN]
I'm not the most literate,[N]
but I can read people better than most.[AN]
Don't need any powers to help me.[N]
Sorry for troubling you, Groto.[A]
[MidRight]Longxia is genuine.[N]
Groto will not forget this.[AN]
Does this make Longxia[Beat][N]
Friend of Groto?[A]
[MidLeft]A friend, eh?[N]
So forward![AN]
Sure.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I'm sure I'll find a use for[N]
you yet, Groto![A][X]

## Longxia_Fangai_B

[MidLeft][LoadLongxia][MidRight][LoadFangai]
[MidLeft]
Fangai, what are you doing?[N]
Are those[Beat] sea urchins!?[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed they are, Longxia.[N]
Behold, their spiny glory.[AN]
Ack![N][CloseEyes]
They're a rather prickly bunch.[A][OpenEyes]
[MidLeft]
You're telling me. How in[N]
Byelen's name did you get those?[AN]
Prickly and pokey these sea hedgehogs[N]
may be, they're a delicacy![AN]
Requires diving into a reef,[N]
scooping 'em off coral,[AN]
cleaning and shearing and scraping.[N]
All for but a tiny morsel of flesh.[AN]
It's been many years[Beat][N]
since I last had one.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, Longxia, I[Beat][N]
don't know if I have[Beat][N]
Enough to share, you know.[A]
[MidLeft]
You glutton! Shoving seafood[N]
down your gullet like a starving[N]
pelican! A true scavenger, you are![AN]
Have you forgotten all the good[N]
I've done for you? To be fair,[N]
even I can't keep track of it![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I know there was helping me[N]
get out of that Cherne cult[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Yeah! You were getting wrapped up[N]
in all kinds of rubbish, Fangai.[AN]
Your skull is as thick as a clam's[N]
shell, you know.[AN]
I'd prattle on about all of the other[N]
things I've down for you.[AN]
Don't get me started on saving you[N]
from that sea otter.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
We agreed to never talk about it![A]
[MidLeft]
Then give me some urchin, you idiot![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I cannot[Beat] I'm preparing it for[N]
a date[Beat] with a new woman![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A date!? You'd toss aside friendship[N]
for a chance at romance?[N]
Bah! What a lout you are![AN]
Go! Shove off, then![N]
I can only hope this date of yours[N]
enjoys urchin![A][X]

## Longxia_Fangai_A

[MidLeft][LoadLongxia][MidRight][LoadFangai]
Ah, Longxia. There you are.[N]
It's been a while, hasn't it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'd say. Since the urchin incident,[N]
you'd seldom look at me.[AN]
Averting my gaze as though[N]
locking eyes would kill you![A]
[MidRight]
You know, Longxia, I was wrong.[N]
I made a grave error.[AN]
[MidLeft]
In preparing the urchin to eat,[N]
or what?[A]
[MidRight]
No, this date[Beat][N]
Oh, Longxia, it was awful![AN]
I realized immediately what[N]
a fool I was.[A]
[MidLeft]
We all make mistakes, Fangai.[N]
I'm just glad you realized it yourself.[AN]
You're a grown man. Too well[N]
grown of a man, in fact,[AN]
to be having a mother hen[N]
pecking you all day.[AN]
So then, what was so bad[N]
about this date?[AN]
Was she one of those who[N]
only talked about the weather?[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, Longxia, I really felt she would[N]
be the one for me, you know.[AN]
Her countenance was unlike any other.[N]
She was a financier of sorts.[AN]
She spoke of the weather, as anyone[N]
else would in idle conversation,[AN]
and even spoke of traveling[N]
into the mountains and over the sea![AN]
Her interests were seemingly plentiful,[N]
and I felt we'd never exhaust topics[AN]
to discuss 'til the end of days![N]
Ah, but it was too good to be true.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sounds like quite the catch.[N]
What went wrong?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] She hated the urchin![N]
I was bamboozled, flabbergasted,[N]
distraught, and most of all, saddened.[AN]
Her diet was so limited, her palate[N]
so unimaginative, I lost all interest![N]
She only cared to eat chicken.[AN]
But it must be grilled. Byelen forbid[N]
it be covered in sauce![N]
She winced at the idea of seasoning![AN]
For even salt would be too much![N]
How does one live like this, Longxia?[N]
I've never felt so foolish![A]
[MidRight]
Something tells me that your other[N]
escapades would make you an even[N]
greater fool, but I'll spare you.[A]
[MidLeft]
So anyway, I wanted to apologize.[N]
I got swept away in yet another idea[Beat][N]
A romantic one, this was,[AN]
but it blinded me to what really mattered.[N]
Longxia, you've always been a true friend.[N]
And I wronged you by being so selfish.[AN]
I thought I'd make it up to you.[N]
So, I went to the nearest market[N]
and got us your favorite, tuna.[AN]
Behold the glistening of its[N]
fatty belly! The most tender meat,[N]
typically served to royalty![A]
[MidRight]
Are you insane!?[N]
This is what kings eat![N]
You know how expensive it is?[AN]
How on earth did you afford to[N]
buy that here, Fangai?![N]
I know you're no son of royalty.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Never mind that![N]
Just know I bought the highest quality[N]
I could find.[AN]
I only hope that I can enjoy it[N]
with the highest quality of friend[N]
I could have, Longxia![A]
[MidRight]
Don't be stupid![N]
But I forgive you all the same.[N]
I was wrong to snap at you.[AN]
But I won't be wrong when[N]
I figure out how much you spent[N]
on these later.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's a problem for tomorrow.[N]
For now, let's eat![A][X]

## Cadenza_Longxia_C
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm? A bard, eh?[N]
Haven't seen you around before.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]
A tragedy, it is, but I can't[N]
expect unwashed pirates to know of me[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Unwashed? Listen, lad, I ain't no[N]
raw vegetable, I'm quite cultured.[AN]
And I certainly am not a pirate,[N]
despite all appearances.[AN]
I'm a ship captain and merchant.[N]
Call me Longxia.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
I see a captain of the sea,[N]
but yet you've never heard of me?[AN]
A travesty, a tragedy, a sham![N]
For I am Cadenza![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nope, never heard of you.[N]
You're a bard though, right?[AN]
Writing music and all some such?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
More than write music, Longxia.[N]
I am a storyteller.[AN]
I am a weaver of epic tales,[N]
a teller of tragedies,[AN]
a chronicler of ages long past.[N]
I make men weep and women swoon.[AN]
Tales once left to languish in obscurity[N]
live on through my voice![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I've never heard of you.[N]
Do you write sea shanties?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
A sea shanty!? I would never![N]
Such a low, low artform![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, everyone likes a sea shanty.[N]
Enjoy [OpenQuote]languishing in obscurity" then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
What! Wait just a moment![A][X]

## Cadenza_Longxia_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenMidLeft]
Longxia, I've come to consider your offer.[N]
I will[Beat] write a sea shanty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's about time. Can't blame you[N]
for selling out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Speaking of selling[Beat][N]
As an esteemed bard of songs,[N]
I require patronage to write.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
Patronage? Like what, you want me[N]
to pay you for your time?[AN]
That's not how the world works.[N]
I'm doing you a favor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Payment for time is exactly what I seek.[N]
I cannot write if my time is not paid for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You mean you aren't just a bard for fun?[N]
You do it to make money?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's right. While sometimes I write[N]
for pleasure, I do also need to eat.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
How much can you make writing songs?[N]
Do you do alright with it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Songwriting isn't necessarily a lucrative[N]
profession. At least not in coin.[AN]
However, one can achieve great fame[N]
with but a single hit or story,[AN]
one recounted for generations.[N]
Etched in the public conscious![A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I bet you'd probably make a killing[N]
if you stopped with the epics,[N]
and full-on committed to sea shanties.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But sea shanties are such a base[N]
form of art! My tongue stings even[N]
suggesting it is close to an artform.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Is that so? Well, I bet I can write[N]
a better sea shanty than you.[N]
Let's make it interesting.[AN]
We each write our own sea shanty.[N]
Whoever writes the better one[N]
gives the other one five hundred gold.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Five hundred gold!?[N]
You'd just throw that money away?[N]
Very well, I accept![A][X]

## Cadenza_Longxia_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, the day has finally come.[N]
Judgment day. A day to sing about.[AN]
Perhaps I should write a song about[N]
my impending victory, Longxia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I can barely hear you over your ego![N]
We both know I'm the expert here.[AN]
Shall we compare notes then?[N]
See who really is the best?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, here is what I've written.[N]
It's a story of a sea captain.[AN]
The sea captain wishes to sail[N]
into uncharted waters, but is afraid.[AN]
They're deemed crazy, borderline insane.[N]
But they wish to forge forward.[AN]
The tale continues as they pack their bags[N]
and sail into the dark unknown.[AN]
You see, they represent the courage[N]
of sailors around Orodreth,[AN]
but some interpretations may be that[N]
the sailor represents Byelen.[AN]
For they wish to be a light[N]
in a dark, unknown expanse.[AN]
That is how we found our world.[N]
I challenge you to do better.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't read your handwriting.[N]
I don't think this counts.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You illiterate, stupid-[N]
how does it not [OpenQuote]count"?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's not a sea shanty.[N]
This looks like a novel.[AN]
Just because it's about[N]
the ocean and a sailor,[AN]
doesn't mean it's a sea shanty.[N]
I think I win by default.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nonsense! Utter nonsense![N]
Let me see what you wrote![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sure, but I don't think you'd[N]
appreciate such high art.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I AM HIGH ART![N]
I will not take these transgressions![AN]
Let me see here so I can critique[N]
this so-called art of yours.[AN]
[Beat][N]
[Beat][AN]
[OpenQuote]I take her to the diner,[N]
in clear and stormy weather,[AN]
From Decia to Mahemen[N]
we sail the seas together.[AN]
Mackerel and soft-shell crab[N]
served with dinner rolls,[AN]
Tethered to my waste she is,[N]
best friends we are forever."[AN]
[Beat] And then it just repeats?[N]
What is this nonsense?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You don't even know what a shanty is, huh?[N]
It's a work song.[AN]
It's rhythmic.[N]
This one I wrote for hauling a load.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm.[N]
I see.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I think it's clear who the winner is.[N]
Don't you agree?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ergh[Beat] best two of three![N]
I pick the format this time![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ha! Look at him sweat![N]
You're on, Cadenza![A][X]
