[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidRight]Ichwep, why the long face?[N]
You're looking awfully sad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's because you keep bothering me.[N]
This is a battlefield, Milo.[AN]
While I admire your joviality,[N]
we could die at any minute.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]All the more reason to take it easy.[N]
If you take life too seriously, you won't[N]
be able to ever enjoy it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We're soldiers, Milo. This isn't[N]
something people do for fun. I'm trying[N]
to make a living.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Making a living by trying not to die?[N]
Sounds a bit counterintuitive to me, Ichwep.[N]
Come on, don't be so serious![A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Focus on the battle, Milo.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidRight]Here she is, Miss Ichwep![N]
Looks like we're battle partners once more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]While I'd say I'm lucky to be alive,[N]
I must've done something terrible in a past[N]
life to keep finding myself fielded with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why, do you think me incompetent?[N]
I'll have you know, I've won many bouts.[N]
At the very least, I've not died yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]An impressive feat.[N]
And no, it's just[Beat] never mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No secrets from me, Ichwep![N]
I am your father, after all.[AN]
You're supposed to tell me these[N]
sorts of things, how you're feeling and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You really need to stop telling[N]
everyone we're related.[AN]
Half the army believes it.[N]
We look nothing alike.[AN]
I'm not even that much younger[N]
than you.[AN]
But never mind all that,[N]
we have a battle to fight.[AN]
Come on, Milo, stop getting me[N]
distracted. You'll get us both killed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Touchy, touchy! Alright, alright.[N]
I'll try my best to behave.[A][X]

## Ichwep_Milo_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidLeft]Milo, you're still here.[N]
Are you doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's this, Miss Ichwep,[N]
the most proper soldier in the land,[AN]
wants to check up on ol' Milo?[N]
I could use a warm drink,[AN]
but otherwise I'm doing just fine.[N]
Cleo and Loewe rely on us both now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They do[Beat][N]
I just hope we can win.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No time for doubting yourself now, Ichwep.[N]
We're here because we're good soldiers.[AN]
Loewe and Cleo put us on the field[N]
because they trust us to get it done.[AN]
Sure, we may not have the fanciest pedigree,[N]
horses, wyverns, or anything of great value,[AN]
but we are tenacious![N]
We show up when we're asked to.[AN]
That's more than most people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're[Beat] much more perceptive[N]
than I'd given you credit for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And I know it was a sore spot for you, too.[N]
You are always so serious.[AN]
You've got nothing to prove, Ichwep.[N]
You're a valuable soldier,[AN]
not just some throwaway pawn.[N]
That's why we're here, talking.[AN]
We bring value to this army.[N]
To this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And I suppose that's why you[N]
never took things too seriously?[AN]
Because all along you felt needed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Now who is the perceptive one?[N]
We've learned quite a bit about each other.[AN]
All of these battles.[N]
We're war veterans now, Ichwep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[N]
Hard to believe we've come this far.[AN]
I'm surprised I'm still seeing battles,[N]
and that we haven't been discharged.[AN]
We both know you're probably a better[N]
chef than you are a soldier, Milo.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hogwash! I'm truthfully[N]
a better comedian![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, now you're letting all[N]
of this get to your head.[AN]
The enemy will be able to spot your[N]
ego if you keep it up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pah! Look at you, hamming it up![N]
You would've shooed me away just weeks ago.[AN]
Now your words have bite![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'd like to think my spear[N]
bites harder.[AN]
Come on, Milo, let's do our jobs.[N]
Remember how we got here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right. To battle, Ichwep![A][X]
