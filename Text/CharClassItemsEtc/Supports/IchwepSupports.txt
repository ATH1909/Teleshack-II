[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidRight]Ichwep, why the long face?[N]
You're looking awfully sad.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's because you keep bothering me.[N]
This is a battlefield, Milo.[AN]
While I admire your joviality,[N]
we could die at any minute.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]All the more reason to take it easy.[N]
If you take life too seriously, you won't[N]
be able to ever enjoy it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]We're soldiers, Milo. This isn't[N]
something people do for fun. I'm trying[N]
to make a living.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Making a living by trying not to die?[N]
Sounds a bit counterintuitive to me, Ichwep.[N]
Come on, don't be so serious![A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Focus on the battle, Milo.[A][X]

## Ichwep_Milo_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidRight]Here she is, Miss Ichwep![N]
Looks like we're battle partners once more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]While I'd say I'm lucky to be alive,[N]
I must've done something terrible in a past[N]
life to keep finding myself fielded with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why, do you think me incompetent?[N]
I'll have you know, I've won many bouts.[N]
At the very least, I've not died yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]An impressive feat.[N]
And no, it's just[Beat] never mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No secrets from me, Ichwep![N]
I am your father, after all.[AN]
You're supposed to tell me these[N]
sorts of things, how you're feeling and all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You really need to stop telling[N]
everyone we're related.[AN]
Half the army believes it.[N]
We look nothing alike.[AN]
I'm not even that much younger[N]
than you.[AN]
But never mind all that,[N]
we have a battle to fight.[AN]
Come on, Milo, stop getting me[N]
distracted. You'll get us both killed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Touchy, touchy! Alright, alright.[N]
I'll try my best to behave.[A][X]

## Ichwep_Milo_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenMidLeft]Milo, you're still here.[N]
Are you doing well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]What's this, Miss Ichwep,[N]
the most proper soldier in the land,[AN]
wants to check up on ol' Milo?[N]
I could use a warm drink,[AN]
but otherwise I'm doing just fine.[N]
Cleo and Loewe rely on us both now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They do[Beat][N]
I just hope we can win.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No time for doubting yourself now, Ichwep.[N]
We're here because we're good soldiers.[AN]
Loewe and Cleo put us on the field[N]
because they trust us to get it done.[AN]
Sure, we may not have the fanciest pedigree,[N]
horses, wyverns, or anything of great value,[AN]
but we are tenacious![N]
We show up when we're asked to.[AN]
That's more than most people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're[Beat] much more perceptive[N]
than I'd given you credit for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And I know it was a sore spot for you, too.[N]
You are always so serious.[AN]
You've got nothing to prove, Ichwep.[N]
You're a valuable soldier,[AN]
not just some throwaway pawn.[N]
That's why we're here, talking.[AN]
We bring value to this army.[N]
To this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And I suppose that's why you[N]
never took things too seriously?[AN]
Because all along you felt needed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Now who is the perceptive one?[N]
We've learned quite a bit about each other.[AN]
All of these battles.[N]
We're war veterans now, Ichwep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right.[N]
Hard to believe we've come this far.[AN]
I'm surprised I'm still seeing battles,[N]
and that we haven't been discharged.[AN]
We both know you're probably a better[N]
chef than you are a soldier, Milo.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hogwash! I'm truthfully[N]
a better comedian![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, now you're letting all[N]
of this get to your head.[AN]
The enemy will be able to spot your[N]
ego if you keep it up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pah! Look at you, hamming it up![N]
You would've shooed me away just weeks ago.[AN]
Now your words have bite![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'd like to think my spear[N]
bites harder.[AN]
Come on, Milo, let's do our jobs.[N]
Remember how we got here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's right. To battle, Ichwep![A][X]

## Ichwep_Mantou_C
[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]That was a good strike.[N]
You seem to have a penchant for[N]
the dramatic. Have we met before?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]Can't say we have.[N]
I'm just a[Beat] farmer, nothing more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you certain?[N]
I feel as though I've seen you before.[AN]
Before taking up the axe full-time,[N]
what sort of farm did you run?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Err[Beat] you know. The usual.[N]
A bit of this and that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Poultry? Blueberries? Flax?[N]
Cotton? Maize? Boysenberries?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Boysenberries![N]
Yes, I grew boysenberries.[AN]
It was a small, er, operation.[N]
Nothing too fancy, but you know,[AN]
not a lot of people eat those.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a shame, really.[N]
They were easier to find in my youth.[AN]
Feels as though they've fallen out[N]
of fashion folks in Decia, huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, that's why I'm here![N]
They're a real sensitive fruit.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Are they? I thought they'd[N]
be hardy as a hybrid of other berries.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, they can be hardy,[N]
but some of them cry over everything.[AN]
I mean, they're easily ruined by bad weather.[N]
That's what I meant. Yep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You seem quite knowledgable.[N]
You know, I'd like to have them again[Beat][AN]
Maybe you could help me find some?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Er, yes, precisely, sure![N]
I can do that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If I can live through another fight,[N]
perhaps I should treat myself, right?[AN]
Anyhow, it was good chatting with you.[N]
What was your name? I'm Ichwep.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Mantou! Farmer Mantou,[N]
that's who I am. Yep![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Mantou, good to meet you.[N]
Until then, stay safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] Damn it all![N]
How long must I keep up this charade?[AN]
I was sure I'd seen her before.[N]
But not at the farmer's market[Beat][A][X]

## Ichwep_Mantou_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidLeft]Farmer Mantou![N]
There you are. How are you faring?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! Hello, er, Itchwipe.[N]
Good to see you again.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Ichwep.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ichwep! Right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]I wanted to see if you had[N]
any news on the boysenberries this year.[AN]
In fact, I was hoping we'd get more[N]
for the entire army.[AN]
Many of them are sadly unfamiliar.[N]
I figured you may know where to get them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, during war and all,[N]
it's a little more difficult.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm, I see.[N]
I also wanted to ask you.[AN]
Are you a rancher, too?[N]
That's what Loewe told me when I asked him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why are you talking to the[N]
Commander about me!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Why are you sweating?[N]
I just wanted to see if he felt[N]
berries would be good for the army.[AN]
We can only eat so much hard tack and[N]
grilled meat from the hunt. You need[N]
some nutritious fruits as well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's why I diversified[N]
my operation. I started slaughtering[N]
cattle, then changed to growing berries.[AN]
Most importantly, I never robbed, stole,[N]
cheated, or anything like that.[N]
It was an honest effort.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Mantou, are you okay?[N]
You are sweating like a pig.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I[Beat] I[Beat] didn't do anything wrong![N]
Leave me alone![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]War[Beat] it certainly affects each[N]
of us differently.[AN]
I can't even fathom the trauma of losing[N]
your crops and needing to draw the sword.[AN]
I should do something nice for Mantou.[N]
It feels like the right thing to do.[A][X]

## Ichwep_Mantou_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadIchwep][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidLeft]Mantou! There you are.[N]
I've been looking for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You are looking for me?[N]
Why? I did nothing wrong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look, I know war is terrible[N]
and I can't imagine what this is doing to you.[AN]
Not everyone is cut out for it.[N]
You're brave enough to take up arms.[AN]
I know how hard it is to draw your blade[N]
and charge into the unknown.[AN]
That's why I wanted to get you[N]
something nice.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]You got me[Beat] a present?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]That's right.[N]
Fresh boysenberries.[AN]
I was able to find a farmer[N]
in Chouwouj who grew them.[AN]
It cost quite a bit to get them here,[N]
but I thought the comfort of home[AN]
would keep you eat ease.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ichwep, that's[Beat] so nice.[N]
But I'm afraid[Beat] I lied to you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There's no need to feel shame.[N]
These are hard times for everyone.[AN]
Come now, join me for some berries.[N]
They're fresh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]That's what I mean.[N]
I haven't been truthful.[N]
I'm a fugitive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]About what?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Everything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Everything?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]I am no farmer.[N]
I am no rancher. I'm a criminal.[N]
A bandit. A thief. A brigand![AN]
I joined this army under the guise[N]
of a displaced farmer to cool off.[N]
I'd desert at first opportunity.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You[Beat] lied to me about all that?[N]
About the berries? About the ranch?[N]
Why!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]To protect myself.[N]
Listen, Ichwep, I'm a selfish person.[N]
I've not had an easy, honest life.[AN]
In fact, I think I recognized you.[N]
A few years back we crossed blades[N]
in a skirmish. I knew I recognized you.[AN]
I probably killed some of your friends[N]
in those fights. There was a lot of heat[N]
on me, so I hid out, changed my name[Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]I'm a bit at a loss.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]If you want to kill me,[N]
then just do it here. Right now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is not my place to dispense[N]
justice, Mantou.[AN]
At least, not like this.[N]
However, I find this all hard to believe.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[N]
I'm telling the truth![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you were really this bad brigand[N]
as you claim, why fight so ferociously?[AN]
Why stay this long? You've had[N]
many opportunities to flee.[AN]
Mantou, perhaps this can be a new[N]
beginning for you.[AN]
You can transcend the mask[Beat][N]
Become something more than a bandit.[AN]
More than a footnote of history.[N]
You can be good.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hm, you're saying I could turn[N]
my life around, eh?[AN]
Well, I don't know if that's in the cards.[N]
But maybe I'll stick around[Beat] 'til the end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And I'll be by your side, Mantou.[N]
Just no more lies. No more cheating.[AN]
We've made quite a team so far,[N]
and I won't let the past change that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ichwep, you're a stronger woman[N]
than me, that much is certain.[AN]
I'm[Beat] grateful to call you a friend.[N]
Just[Beat] keep this all a secret, yeah?[A][X]
