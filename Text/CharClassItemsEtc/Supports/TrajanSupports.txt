I never fully trusted Kwame,[N]
but still, I can't believe it.[AN]
After making it this far,[N]
our final opponent is one[N]
of our own comrades?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, there's not much that[N]
a betrayer can say about another,[N]
so I won't speak too harshly.[AN]
Still, this feeling[Beat][N]
I can't say I like it much.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Neither do I, but we can't sit here[N]
and wallow over it. One more battle,[N]
and we'll have won, at long last.[AN]
[MidRight]
Aye. No more Cythes, no more gods[Beat][N]
All by the stroke of our blades![AN]
It seems hard to believe after all[N]
we've been through, eh old friend?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe, but I'll be grateful for it.[AN]
Keeping track of all these weapons[N]
and heroes makes my head spin.[AN]
I can't wait to get home and get[N]
back to returning Decia to what it[N]
was like before Cythes attacked.[AN]

[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, what's your plan, Boro?[N]
I don't imagine you'll find[N]
much mercenary work after the war.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
There's always some, but the idea[N]
doesn't appeal to me anymore.[AN]
Gold isn't worth what it was,[N]
not with Orodreth being so unstable.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm[Beat] Mahemen's better off than us,[N]
and Chouwouj has a fragile peace[N]
upheld by its various warlords,[AN]
but both Cythes and Decia need work[N]
before they can stand on their own.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Say, Trajan.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What is it?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I doubt you can ever trust me like[N]
back when the four of us dreamed of[N]
liberation, but, if you'll have me,[AN]
I'd like to help out any way I can.[AN]
I'm not much for politics, but even in[N]
times of peace, a spear is always useful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're right about that. I intend to[N]
create a council of Decians, each[N]
member overseeing one part of the realm.[AN]
If you accept, and most Decians don't[N]
oppose your appointment, you'd make[N]
for a fine master of arms, Boro.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's[Beat] more than I deserve.[N]
Are you certain, Trajan?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Loewe told me about what you did,[N]
you know. I can't say I understand[N]
why you left us in the lurch,[AN]
but it doesn't change that you helped[N]
Dragana and the others escape, right?[AN]
In that moment, you showed who you are[N]
and what you stand for, and you did it[N]
again in Mahemen, Chouwouj, and here.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Heh. Well, if you think so, then[N]
I won't question it. For Dragana[Beat][N]
Let's make Decia whole again, Trajan.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Indeed, old friend. For Dragana![A][X]
