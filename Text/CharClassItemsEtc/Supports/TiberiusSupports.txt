[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Watch where you swing[N]
that sword of yours.[N]
You almost took my head off![A]
[OpenMidRight]My apologies, I am still a[N]
bit of a novice with the blade.[N]
It looks as though you're unharmed, though.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Luckily, for now I am.[N]
Say, you dress like a noble.[N]
Where do you hail from?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]I'm Ojasvi Srivastana.[N]
I'm from Mahemen. And you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Mahemen, huh? Guess that's why[N]
I didn't recognize you.[N]
Srivastana[Beat] that's the textile merchant?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that's right. I'm his daughter.[N]
I was studying in Cythes when they invaded[N]
Mahemen, so I fled to avoid capture.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]I see, it makes sense how you'd end[N]
up here. I'm Tiberius, by the way.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well met, Tiberius.[N]
You're a Decian noble, I take it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat]What gave it away?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]It isn't too hard to pick up[N]
who the nobles are among us.[AN]
Dress and demeanor are usually[N]
the two giveaways for me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Hm, your father sells a few[N]
pieces of woven fabrics, stikes it rich,[N]
and you call yourself a noble?[AN]
Let me tell you something, Ojasvi[N]
Srivastana of Mahemen, buying and selling[N]
are different games than war and politics.[A]

[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Tiberius.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, Ojasvi. What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]I was thinking about our[N]
conversation last time.[AN]
About what it means to be a noble.[N]
How did your family become nobles?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Become? We've always been nobles.[N]
Our line harkens back to the founding[N]
of Decia. In some ways, we are Decia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]So in your view, nobility[N]
is not something earned, but something[N]
given, or bestowed, upon someone?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's right. You can't buy[N]
your way into nobility. At least,[N]
that's how I feel about it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]I find that explanation a bit hard[N]
to accept, Tiberius.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't say I'm surprised.[N]
Everyone wants to be noble,[AN]
but it's not something you can aspire[N]
to be. You are, or you aren't.[AN]
Getting rich doesn't make you a noble.[N]
It's bestowed upon you in times of old.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How did your ancestors become[N]
nobles, then? Surely, at the dawn of time,[AN]
there were no nobles or anything[N]
of the sort. From what I read,[AN]
early humans walked around in[N]
small bands, eating fruit and hunting boars.[AN]
You're human, just like I am.[N]
Just like everyone else here.[AN]
[Beat] Just like those we fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat] What's your point?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]Why do you think the word[N]
we use is [OpenQuote]noble" anyway?[N]
It has more than one meaning.[AN]
Sure, it is a class of people,[N]
those of an exhalted bloodline from[N]
times of old,[AN]
but we also speak of nobility[N]
in having or showing fine personal[N]
qualities or high moral principles.[AN]
It is less a state of being to be[N]
labeled as or not by birth,[N]
but determined by action.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][Beat] That's a load of dung![N]
You're born a noble, or you're[N]
born a commoner.[AN]
Sure, you can exceed your station[N]
of birth through virtuous action,[N]
but you'd not be a true noble.[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat]Forget it, this conversation[N]
is pointless. When I saw a nobleman[N]
fighting among the rank and file,[AN]
I assumed he'd be a virtuous man[N]
of high calibre, but instead he[N]
cares only to stand above others.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Ojasvi![N]
Damn it all[Beat] Is she right?[N][CloseEyes]
Was it father who lead me astray?[A][X]

## Tiberius_Ojasvi_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTiberius][OpenMidRight][LoadOjasvi]
[OpenMidLeft]Ojasvi[Beat][N]
Will you please talk to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]Is that you, Tiberius?[N]
I didn't realize you could see me[N]
from atop your high perch.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very funny.[N]
Do you want an award for[N]
your comedy, Ojasvi?[AN]
Look, I didn't come here to argue.[N]
I came here to apologize.[N]
[Beat] You're right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Right about what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]About a lot of things,[N]
but specifically about what we discussed.[N]
About what it means to be a noble.[AN]
You have to understand, I grew up[N]
in a castle in Decia as the nephew[N]
of Lord Cidor. I was born on a pedestal.[AN]
I was always told I was better[N]
than others because of my lineage.[N]
That I was special for being born.[AN]
Everyone around me wanted to be me.[N]
They were jealous of me.[N]
[Beat] But it was never for how I acted.[AN]
It was for what I was,[N]
not for who I was. A noble[N]
of Decia, born into a great life.[AN]
I had read that our ancestors[N]
achieved nobility through virtuous action[N]
in war and diplomacy,[AN]
but that never stopped those around me[N]
from saying it was a righteous gift.[N]
Not something earned, but bestowed.[AN]
Perhaps, in a way, it was bestowed[N]
to me by my ancient ancestors,[N]
who themselves earned the title.[AN]
I know I've gone on quite a bit[N]
about this, but I say this all to say,[N]
I'm sorry. I was wrong about it.[AN]
I suppose[Beat] It can be hard to shake[N]
ideas beaten into you from youth.[N]
Don't hold it against me, alright?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]Tiberius[Beat][N]
I forgive you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I need to do more with myself.[N]
Become a noble not in name only,[AN]
but through virtuous action,[N]
as you so eloquently put it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is the duty of those who[N]
have to help those who do not.[AN]
I think that is the goal of nobles.[N]
Use what power we have to help.[AN]
At least, that is the ideal[N]
I strive for now.[AN]
The suffering of war cuts[N]
wide and deep, Tiberius.[AN]
Many people across the land[N]
will need help when this is all over.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]And I intend to help them, you'll see.[N]
I think I know what we can do[Beat][A][X]
