Oh, why did I ever agree to join the[N]
Liberators? Every day is dangerous,[N]
more than anything I've faced before![AN]
Helman, why did you get me into this?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadJenny]
Oy, Meldan! What're you standing there[N]
for? We've got a target to get to,[N]
so don't sit around and hold us back.[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
O-Oh, but you are mistaken, Jenny![N]
I was[Beat] surveying the area, you see.[AN]
Perhaps you will understand when you[N]
have fought as much as I, but nothing[N]
is more important than gathering info.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Really? I didn't know that you could[N]
survey anything with your eyes shut.[AN]
What, are you listening for enemy[N]
footsteps with your heightened senses?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, that's exactly right! Closing[N]
my eyes allows me to hear the entire[N]
battlefield, making it easy to-[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Easy to get skewered by an arrow?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Oh, you were being sarcastic.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yep. C'mon, Meldan, you can't pull one[N]
over on me. If you're afraid, say so.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
M-Me? Afraid? Why, you must be mistaken.[AN]
How could someone as knowledgeable in[N]
battle as myself feel something like fear?[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't know, don't care. Let's just[N]
focus on the mission for now.[AN]
Try not to space out again, Meldan.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
That Jenny[Beat] No respect for her elders![AN]
And yet, I can hardly say she's lying,[N]
with the state I've been in recently.[N]
Oh, Helman[Beat] What should I do?[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Ah, young Jenny! Well met, my friend.[N]
How fare you on this fine day?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Uh[Beat] same as usual, I guess.[N]
Nothin' seems out of the ordinary,[N]
except that new attitude of yours.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oho? So you've noticed my change?[N]
Very observant, Jenny. Very observant![AN]
The other day was[Beat] simply an oddity.[N]
My knightly form has returned at last![AN]
[MidRight]
Knightly, huh[Beat] Everyone and their[N]
mother's a [OpenQuote]knight" around here,[N]
so no sense in bragging about that.[AN]
That said, you don't look about[N]
ready to wet your pants anymore,[N]
so that's definitely an improvement.[AN]
What changed you so quick, Meldan?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Coarse as ever, aren't you[Beat][N]
Well, I simply realized my mistake.[AN]
All throughout our battles, I focused[N]
on the strongest enemies before us.[AN]
I thought it my duty, as an experienced[N]
knight among novices like yourself.[AN]
But now, I understand my true role.[N]
I should turn my lance on the rest,[N]
as not one of them can stop me![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So beatin' up on the weak[N]
made you more confident?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You always have the worst way[N]
of phrasing things, young one.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, now I actually am curious.[AN]
What you said about bein' more[N]
experienced than us is true,[N]
but you never act like it.[AN]
No matter how good of a spearman[N]
you are, or how well you ride a[N]
horse, you've got no composure.[AN]
No courage.[A] How does someone fight[N]
without that for as long as you have?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That[Beat] Well[Beat] I mean to say[Beat][N]
[Beat]Please excuse me, Jenny.[N]
I am[Beat] needed elsewhere.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Ah heck, I think I was a little[N]
too harsh. Hope I didn't make the[N]
fella cry[Beat] but seriously, how?[A][X]

Hey, Meldan, hold on a second![N]
I've got somethin' to say to you.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Oh? Here to hurt my feelings again?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, no. Look, I'm[Beat] sorry, alright?[N]
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.[N]
I was just genuinely curious, really.[AN]
If you're really as scared as you seem,[N]
then why keep fighting? I'm sure the[N]
Liberators woulda been fine if you left.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No. I wouldn't have any if I left,[N]
anyhow. You see, I owe the Liberators[N]
a debt for saving my old friend, Helman.[AN]
That foul Duke Cidor imprisoned him,[N]
but the Liberators saved Helman from[N]
Selese's jails and sent him on his way.[AN]
After I heard about that[Beat] Well,[N]
I couldn't very well leave them[N]
without repaying them for that.[AN]
[MidRight]
And you don't think you've done enough?[N]
Cidor's been dead for a while now.[N]
Why not go back to Decia and rest?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, let me pose that question to you.[N]
You joined at the same time as I,[N]
for what I assume are similar reasons.[AN]
[MidRight]
The Liberators[Beat] They did somethin'[N]
similar for me, too. My sister got[N]
locked up in those jails too.[AN]
It's thanks to them she's free.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][OneLineBox]
Ha[Beat] Hahahahahaha![AN]
[MidRight]
W-What's so funny, Meldan?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, it's just[Beat] We are much more[N]
similar than I thought, Jenny.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, I guess we are[Beat] Y'know though,[N]
you're a lot braver than I am.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Oh? Not that I am unappreciative of a[N]
rare compliment from you, but how[N]
do you figure? I'm[Beat] a coward.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, but that just makes you more[N]
impressive. If I was afraid of all[N]
that you were, I'd never have stayed.[AN]
I wouldn't even be able to raise my[N]
sword, let alone stick around.[AN]
That you're able to keep fighting[N]
while shivering in your boots[Beat][N]
Well, I've got a lot to learn from you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So you finally see my true nature.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Excellent, Jenny! If you wish to learn[N]
from me, then follow my example![AN]
I shall train you into a knight[N]
that surpasses even myself![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Really? Well, I was plannin' on going[N]
back to the farm[Beat][ToggleSmile] But heck, why not?[AN]
Decia'll need people willing to defend[N]
it after everythin's over, so it may[N]
as well be us, right Meldan?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Erm[Beat] Us?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, yeah. If you're gonna teach me all[N]
that knight stuff, shouldn't you be[N]
practicin' what you preach, sir?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh[Beat] Yes, of course![N]
I would have it no other way![AN]
[MidRight]
Good. Well, I'm goin' on ahead.[N]
I'm lookin' forward to it![AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh dear[Beat] Will I never know peace?[N]
Curse my kind heart![AN][X]

Hey there, Jenny![N]
Need a hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, I've got things covered here.[AN]
Actually[Beat] who are you, anyway?[N]
Did you join us recently?[AN]
[MidRight]
That's right. The name's Tao,[N]
and I'm an archer from Freyse.[AN]
I heard that you were too,[N]
so I wanted to meet you.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That right? Well, I'm glad to have you.[N]
With that accent, I reckon you're from[N]
the Freysian countryside like me?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha, dead on. I guess we're more[N]
similar than I thought. Actually,[N]
I've got a question for you.[AN]
Decia's all done and freed, yeah?[AN]
I could see you joining back when[N]
Cythes still ruled over us,[N]
but why stick around this long?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, well[Beat] To be honest, I joined[N]
in the first place to repay a debt.[AN]
The Liberators saved my sis from[N]
Selese's prisons, so I felt like[N]
I had to make up for their kindness.[AN]
Still, I didn't think I'd done enough[N]
when ol' Cidor fell, so I stayed,[N]
and one thing led to another, I guess.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Your sister, huh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What was that, Tao?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, nothing. I was just thinking[N]
that you had a real good reason.[AN]
Anyway, I didn't mean to hold you up,[N]
so thanks for answering my question.[N]
I'd better get back to the battle.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]The heck was that about?[AN]
This Tao sure seems like an[N]
odd duck[Beat] Oh well, not my problem.[AN]
I got more important things to[N]
worry about than his mutterings.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Oh, you're that Tao fella, yeah?[AN]
Good fighting out there. You're[N]
dang near a wizard with that bow.[AN]
[MidRight]
O-Oh, really? Thanks, but I've still[N]
got a lot to learn before I can agree.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmm[Beat] You did seem a bit out of it,[N]
true. I saw an arrow nearly hit you[N]
while you just stood there dazed.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, that was a close call[Beat][N]
I've been thinkin' too much[N]
on the battlefield for my own good.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Anybody can see that,[N]
but about what?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]My family. When you mentioned your[N]
sister, it all came rushing back[Beat][N]
Memories that I wanted to stay gone.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That so? What kind of memories?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Happy ones, at one time. I'm an only[N]
child, but my cousin was a lot like[N]
an older sister to me back then.[AN]
That's why I remembered them.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
From the way you're talking,[N]
something happened to her?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, it's not an uncommon story.[AN]
She died during the conflict between[N]
Korovai of House Freyse and Duke Cidor,[N]
fighting for what she believed in.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm real sorry to hear that, Tao.[N]
We lost too many good people back[N]
then. And losing a family member[Beat][AN]
Well, I can't imagine what I'd do[N]
if I lost my sister or parents.[AN]
If you ever wanna talk about it,[N]
I'm here to listen if you want.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Thanks. I really appreciate that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course! We'll talk again, alright?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Mi, what would you think now?[N]
I'm fighting for your killers[Beat][N]
Is this really the right path?[AN][X]

Hey, Jenny[Beat] You mind[N]
hearing me out for a bit?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sure, it doesn't look like we've[N]
got too many enemies nearby.[AN]
What's on your mind, Tao?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's related to what we were talking[N]
about before. You said that you[N]
couldn't imagine it, but please try.[AN]
If you were to lose someone close,[N]
what[Beat] what if you went on to do[N]
something they'd disapprove of?[AN]
Would you value honoring your kin,[N]
or following your own ideals?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's a bit too general for[N]
me to say, Tao. And like I said,[AN]
I'm not wearin' your boots,[N]
so I couldn't ever know the answer.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I understand. Sorry,[N]
that was a strange question.[AN]
[MidRight]
Still[Beat] I think you're lookin'[N]
at this with the wrong perspective.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Really?[N]
In what way?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Family ain't a chain holding you back,[N]
one that you've gotta [OpenQuote]honor."[AN]
If you do anything for their sake,[N]
it shouldn't be against your conscience.[N]
You're your own person, after all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So you're saying I'm too focused[N]
on my duty? That I should only care[N]
about my own wishes, not hers?[AN]
[MidRight]
See, you're doin' it again.[AN]
That duty[Beat] Who gave it to you?[N]
Your lost cousin, or yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It was you, yeah? The dead can't speak,[N]
but I don't think that cousin of yours[N]
would want you to be tortured like this.[AN]
That is, if she really cared about you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll have to think it over more,[N]
but you have a point. Following my own[N]
path[Beat] Maybe that's for the best.[AN]
Thanks for talking me through it, Jenny.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, anytime. Say, if you're looking[N]
for a purpose or something like that,[N]
they say returning to your roots is good.[AN]
Maybe try doing that? I don't know.[N]
Anyway, good talk. See you around![AN]
[MidLeft]
She seemed unfazed[Beat] Well, I could[N]
learn from that. "Return to your roots",[N]
hm? Maybe I will do that, after all.[AN][X]
