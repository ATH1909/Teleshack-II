Hey there, Jenny![N]
Need a hand?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, I've got things covered here.[AN]
Actually[Beat] who are you, anyway?[N]
Did you join us recently?[AN]
[MidRight]
That's right. The name's Tao,[N]
and I'm an archer from Freyse.[AN]
I heard that you were too,[N]
so I wanted to meet you.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That right? Well, I'm glad to have you.[N]
With that accent, I reckon you're from[N]
the Freysian countryside like me?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha, dead on. I guess we're more[N]
similar than I thought. Actually,[N]
I've got a question for you.[AN]
Decia's all done and freed, yeah?[AN]
I could see you joining back when[N]
Cythes still ruled over us,[N]
but why stick around this long?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, well[Beat] To be honest, I joined[N]
in the first place to repay a debt.[AN]
The Liberators saved my sis from[N]
Selese's prisons, so I felt like[N]
I had to make up for their kindness.[AN]
Still, I didn't think I'd done enough[N]
when ol' Cidor fell, so I stayed,[N]
and one thing led to another, I guess.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Your sister, huh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What was that, Tao?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, nothing. I was just thinking[N]
that you had a real good reason.[AN]
Anyway, I didn't mean to hold you up,[N]
so thanks for answering my question.[N]
I'd better get back to the battle.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]The heck was that about?[AN]
This Tao sure seems like an[N]
odd duck[Beat] Oh well, not my problem.[AN]
I got more important things to[N]
worry about than his mutterings.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Oh, you're that Tao fella, yeah?[AN]
Good fighting out there. You're[N]
dang near a wizard with that bow.[AN]
[MidRight]
O-Oh, really? Thanks, but I've still[N]
got a lot to learn before I can agree.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmm[Beat] You did seem a bit out of it,[N]
true. I saw an arrow nearly hit you[N]
while you just stood there dazed.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, that was a close call[Beat][N]
I've been thinkin' too much[N]
on the battlefield for my own good.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Anybody can see that,[N]
but about what?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]My family. When you mentioned your[N]
sister, it all came rushing back[Beat][N]
Memories that I wanted to stay gone.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That so? What kind of memories?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Happy ones, at one time. I'm an only[N]
child, but my cousin was a lot like[N]
an older sister to me back then.[AN]
That's why I remembered them.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
From the way you're talking,[N]
something happened to her?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, it's not an uncommon story.[AN]
She died during the conflict between[N]
Korovai of House Freyse and Duke Cidor,[N]
fighting for what she believed in.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm real sorry to hear that, Tao.[N]
We lost too many good people back[N]
then. And losing a family member[Beat][AN]
Well, I can't imagine what I'd do[N]
if I lost my sister or parents.[AN]
If you ever wanna talk about it,[N]
I'm here to listen if you want.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Thanks. I really appreciate that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course! We'll talk again, alright?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Mi, what would you think now?[N]
I'm fighting for your killers[Beat][N]
Is this really the right path?[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Hey, Jenny[Beat] You mind[N]
hearing me out for a bit?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sure, it doesn't look like we've[N]
got too many enemies nearby.[AN]
What's on your mind, Tao?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's related to what we were talking[N]
about before. You said that you[N]
couldn't imagine it, but please try.[AN]
If you were to lose someone close,[N]
what[Beat] what if you went on to do[N]
something they'd disapprove of?[AN]
Would you value honoring your kin,[N]
or following your own ideals?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's a bit too general for[N]
me to say, Tao. And like I said,[AN]
I'm not wearing your boots,[N]
so I couldn't ever know the answer,[N]
especially without any context.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I understand. Sorry,[N]
that was a strange question.[AN]
[MidRight]
Still[Beat] I think you're looking[N]
at this with the wrong perspective.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Really?[N]
In what way?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Family ain't a chain holding you back,[N]
one that you've gotta [OpenQuote]honor."[AN]
If you do anything for their sake,[N]
it shouldn't be against your conscience.[N]
You're your own person, after all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So you're saying I'm too focused[N]
on my duty? That I should only care[N]
about my own wishes, not hers?[AN]
[MidRight]
See, you're doin' it again.[AN]
That duty[Beat] Who gave it to you?[N]
Your lost cousin, or yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It was you, yeah? The dead can't speak,[N]
but I don't think that cousin of yours[N]
would want you to be tortured like this.[AN]
That is, if she really cared about you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll have to think it over more,[N]
but you have a point. Following my own[N]
path[Beat] Maybe that's for the best.[AN]
Thanks for talking me through it, Jenny.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, anytime. Say, if you're looking[N]
for a purpose or something like that,[N]
they say returning to your roots is good.[AN]
Maybe try doing that? I don't know.[N]
Anyway, good talk. See you around![AN]
[MidLeft]
She seemed unfazed[Beat] Well, I could[N]
learn from that. "Return to your roots",[N]
hm? Maybe I will do that, after all.[AN][X]
