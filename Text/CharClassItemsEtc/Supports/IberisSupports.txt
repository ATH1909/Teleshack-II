Nora.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah, hello, Lady Iberis.[N]
Do you require my aid?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, that will not be[N]
reqired.[AN]
You are doing an admirable[N]
job in your duty.[AN]
Perhaps too admirable.[AN]
In the span of a year you've[N]
jumped from a common soldier[AN]
to one of Korovai's most[N]
trusted allies.[AN]
[MidRight]
Is this an accusation of[N]
something, Lady Iberis?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, at least for now.[AN]
Merely an independent[N]
investigation on my part.[AN]
I wish you well, Nora.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
How odd[Beat][AN]
What game are you[N]
playing, Iberis?[AN][X]

[MidRight]
Lady Iberis, were you in[N]
my tent yesterday?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is this about,[N]
Nora?[AN]
[MidRight]
Various items of mine[N]
were tampered with[AN]
when I went to bed[N]
last night.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, yes.[AN]
Merely a continuation of[N]
that investigation.[AN]
But I must ask, how long do[N]
you intend to stay with[AN]
the Liberators now that[N]
Korovai is gone.[AN]
[MidRight]
I intend to continue to aid[N]
those of Freyse who still[AN]
wish to support the Liberators'[N]
ambitions of stopping Cythes.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmm, I see.[AN]
Very well, Nora.[N]
You may be on your way.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Does she think I'm a[N]
traitor?[AN]
Preposterous![AN][X]

Hello, Nora.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Lady Iberis.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I owe you an explanation[N]
for my behavior.[AN]
Given your circumstances, I[N]
did have some suspicion[AN]
of your motives and ability,[N]
given the popularity of espionage,[AN]
whether it be Cythean or a[N]
rival of Lord Korovai.[AN]
However, based on my findings[N]
and observations,[AN]
these beliefs were completely[N]
unfounded.[AN]
I apologize for any inconvenience[N]
I've caused, Nora.[AN]
[MidRight]
I understand.[N]
All is forgiven.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Then let us be off.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Iberis not flaunting her[N]
pride and arrogance for once?[AN]
Maybe she's the suspicious one,[N]
heh heh.[AN][X]

Looks like everything[N]
checks out, Hamlet.[AN]
You're free to be[N]
on your way.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Aye, Lady Iberis![AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Looks like up next[N]
is[Beat] Hans.[AN]
Oh dear[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadHans]
[MidRight]
Hoo boy, inspection[N]
time, isn't it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, and it looks like[N]
not much has changed.[AN]
I'm surprised you even[N]
stick around at this point.[AN]
[MidRight]
And where else would I go?[AN]
You know damn well I don't[N]
have anything else.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Touche.[AN]
Still, you continue[N]
to check out.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Well, I'll be off, then.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
He seems a bit off[N]
for his standards,[AN]
I pray he's alright[Beat][AN][X]

[MidLeft][LoadIberis][MidRight][LoadHans]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hold, Hans![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hm?[AN]
What is it now,[N]
Lady Iberis?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It was about[N]
the inspection.[AN]
You seemed different[N]
than usual.[AN]
Keep in mind, that's[N]
still kinda gloomy,[AN]
but the points still[N]
stands.[AN]
[MidRight]
So I'm not allowed to[N]
have a mood swing,[AN]
just because of[N]
my usual demeanor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, it's not like[N]
that at all![AN]
I just wanted to make[N]
sure you were okay.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I'm fine.[AN]
Now, stop treating every[N]
anomaly as a world changer.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Hans![AN]
That's no way to speak[N]
to a superior![AN][X]

There you are, Hans.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh look, it's Detective Iberis.[AN]
Any more minor abnormalities[N]
you wish to point out today?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Enough with the name-calling, Hans.[N]
I just wanted to apologize for snooping.[AN]
I'm not too proud to[N]
admit when I go overboard.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thank you, Lady Iberis.[AN]
You've finally gotten[N]
over your pride for once.[AN]
Now, if you'll excuse me.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
And now he's back to his[N]
cynical snarkiness.[AN]
Not sure which I'd[N]
take to be, honest.[AN][X]
