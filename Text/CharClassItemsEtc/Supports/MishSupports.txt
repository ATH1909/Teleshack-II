[MidLeft]
Hey! Hey, Mish![AN]
Want to see something[N]
super cool I read about?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
No.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I found this book in the[N]
Zykhra Gate library that's[N]
all about magic weapons![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I've already got one.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
And there's this chapter[N]
about a relic from Chouwouj[N]
that's called the Runespear![AN]
It's super cool![AN]
Here, take a look.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Fine, I'll look.[AN]
If it gets you to[N]
shut up, I guess.[A]
[MidLeft]
They've even got[N]
pictures! Cool, right?[A]
[MidRight]
Let's see[Beat][AN]
uses the wielder's[N]
magical talent[Beat][AN]
heavy weight[Beat][AN]
demands great intelligence[Beat][AN]
I don't think this would[N]
be very useful for you.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, but if I can find this,[N]
I'll have a magic weapon too![AN]
We'll be weapon buddies![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]I'm leaving.[A]
[MidRight]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hey, come back![AN]
I need to show you[N]
the Titan's Fang too![A][X]


## Mish_Tobie_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadTobie][OpenMidRight][LoadMish]
[MidLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]Mish? I need to ask[N]
you about something.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ugh, I keep telling you, I'm[N]
not interested in whatever-[A]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
[N]Whoa, what the heck?[AN]
You look, er[Beat][N]
not too great.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You all right?[N]
What the heck happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
So, it was during the[N]
siege of Castle Selese,[AN]
when we were going up[N]
against[Beat] that archer.[AN]
I'm pretty confident[N]
about this stuff, usually,[AN]
since, y'know, I have you around.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But then she pointed[N]
her bow straight at me,[N]
and I realized something.[AN]
What the heck's the point of[N]
joking around with each other,[N]
like we always do[Beat][AN]
when one of us[N]
could just[Beat] die?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Tobie[Beat][AN]
So, what, you're saying[N]
sorry for the book thing?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sort of.[A] [Beat]Well, actually, yeah.[AN]
It's been forever since I saw Takai,[N]
and we're not even in Decia anymore[Beat][AN]
All we've really got[N]
for family is each other.[A]
[MidRight]
So you want us to stick together[N]
more and stop bickering, huh?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] I think so.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Y'know, I've been a[N]
bit of a jerk to you, too.[AN]
Maybe I should listen to[N]
what you have to say more,[AN]
instead of just dismissing it.[A]
[MidLeft]
So that means you'll look at the[N]
book chapter on the Titan's Fang?[A]
[MidRight]
Eh, maybe. But let's get[N]
through this battle first![A]
[MidLeft]
Alright, Mish. Let's go![N]
I'm with you![A][X]

## MishEllereyCSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMish][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[MidRight]
You, there.[N]
Mish, was it?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yeah? Whaddya want?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I've been told you have a[N]
magical dagger of some sort.[A][N]
May I examine it?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yeah. The Devil's[N]
Dagger, I call it.[A][N]
Here, take a closer look.[A]
[MidRight]
Hmm[Beat][A][N]
red color inlaid into the metal[Beat][N]
not brittle but doesn't bend[Beat][A][N]
Where exactly did you[N]
obtain this dagger, Mish?[A]
[MidLeft]
I made it myself![A] Sort of.[A][N]
I found the blade lying[N]
on the ground one day,[A][N]
and my dad Takai helped me[N]
make it into a proper weapon.[A][N]
All it needed was a handle[N]
and a bit of a sharper edge.[A]
[MidRight]
Interesting. May I borrow[N]
the dagger for a moment?[A][N]
I have some theories about its[N]
true nature, and I'd like to-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Nah.[A]
[MidRight]
Excuse me?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The Devil's Dagger is[N]
my personal weapon.[A][N]
Sorry, but I don't trust[N]
you not to do something[N]
weird to it, or break it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well.[A][N]
My apologies for intruding, Mish.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A][X]

## MishEllereyBSupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMish][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, hey Ellerey.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Are you still mad about[N]
my previous request to[N]
borrow the Devil's Dagger?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
A little.[A][N]
You listened when I said no,[A][N]
which makes you far better[N]
than Tobie in that regard.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Heh.[ToggleSmile][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]You're going to[N]
ask again, aren't you?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not quite.[A][N]
I'd like for you to[N]
bring the dagger to my[N]
forge after this battle.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You have a forge?[N]
How's that work?[A][N]
The army's on the move,[A][N]
and it's not like you can[N]
just tuck an anvil in a tent.[A]
[MidRight]
It's not technically mine.[A][N]
It's the local blacksmith's shop[N]
in a town near our army's camp.[A][N]
I paid her for access to it[N]
in several of my older creations.[A]
[MidLeft]
Huh.[A][N]
So what're you wanting to do[N]
with the Devil's Dagger there?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'd like to compare it[N]
with several other weapon[N]
metals in my collection,[A][N]
and perform some tests[N]
on its unique material.[A][N]
It won't have to leave[N]
your sight, if you're[N]
willing to stay in the room.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What's in it for me?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps[Beat][A]
if I can figure out[N]
the secret of its power,[A][N]
then I can modify[N]
or replicate it.[A][N]
That means you can have[N]
a second such dagger,[A][N]
just as mighty as the first,[A][N]
or make the existing Devil's[N]
Dagger far more powerful.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Far more awesome, you mean.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I suppose so.[A][N]
Is that agreeable to you?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]It's a deal.[N]
I'll see you then, Ellerey.[A]
[MidRight]
Same to you.[A][X]

## MishEllereyASupport
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMish][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[MidRight]
I spoke to several of[N]
the army's other smiths,[A][N]
and we've developed a working[N]
theory about the Devil's Dagger.[A]
[MidLeft]
Does that mean you know[N]
why it's so awesome?[A]
[MidRight]
We believe it's made from a[N]
rare, magical ore called Chernite.[A]
[MidLeft]
Chernite[Beat] That's one[N]
spooky name. The heck is it?[A]
[MidRight]
Chernite is vanishingly uncommon.[A][N]
Only two mines in the Cythean[N]
mountains have ever discovered it,[A][N]
and both were destroyed in the[N]
earthquake twenty-five years ago.[A]
[MidLeft]
So they were the only[N]
ones to ever find it[Beat][A][N]
[ToggleSmile]until me, that is.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Precisely.[A]
The few known deposits of[N]
Chernite were highly valued[A][N]
for their ability to absorb and[N]
channel luck-influencing magic.[A][N]
So if a vein of it[N]
exists in Decia as well[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Then I hit upon the[N]
discovery of a lifetime.[A][N]
Once this war's over, the two[N]
of us should go back to where I[N]
found the dagger to look for more.[A][N]
It was just outside an old riverbed,[N]
in the lowlands by Zykhra Gate[Beat][A][X]

## MishTakaiB

Heh heh heh[Beat][AN]
Say bye-bye to[N]
your tome, Mr. Mage![AN]
[FarFarLeft]
Mish![N]
Look out![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Huh? Dad?[AN]
[Beat]Dang it![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadTakai]
[MidLeft]
Mish![AN]
Mish, are ye[N]
alright?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I'm fine,[N]
but that guy got away![AN]
I almost had his[N]
spell![AN]
[MidLeft]
I just wanted to[N]
make sure yer safe.[AN]
It's pretty darn risky[N]
out here on the battlefield.[AN]
[MidRight]
I've made it this far[N]
and I've been fine,[AN]
so could you please[N]
chill a little?[AN][ClearFace]

'Ey, Mish.[AN]
Can we chat[N]
for a few?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yeah, I'm listenin'.[N]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I wanted to apologize for[N]
messin' things up before.[AN]
Just a couple years back,[N]
ye were just an innocent kid.[AN]
Ye and Tobie never knew about[N]
battle and all it entailed.[AN]
All I wanted was to keep you[N]
two safe, no matter what.[AN]
I guess I never really grew[N]
out o' that way o' thought, huh?[AN]
[MidRight]
I guess you could[N]
say that, heh.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Listen.[AN]
While I would prefer it[N]
if ye stayed safe at home,[AN]
I can't deny the situation[N]
I find meself in.[AN]
Yer growin' up, Mish,[N]
and I need to accept that.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
So that means you won't[N]
pull reckless stunts[N]
like that again?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Exactly, kid.[N]
We're partners now.[AN]
[MidRight]
Thanks, Dad.[AN]
And I'm sorry about[N]
snappin' last time.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Apology accepted.[AN][X]
