Hm[Beat] So that's how you do it?[N]
I'll have to keep that in mind.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadEmil][ThreeLineBox]
Iskra? The heck are you doing,[N]
reading a book with enemies right[N]
by us! You want to die or something?[AN]
[MidLeft]
This isn't just any book, Emil.[AN]
It's a tome that's got all sorts[N]
of neat spells that I'm using.[AN]
See these runes here? They're not[N]
the common Orodrethian language[N]
that everyone uses today.[AN]
In fact, it's written in an ancient[N]
script that Decians used before Cythes[N]
grew into the empire we know today.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er, that's nice and all, but you[N]
still got your nose in a book.[AN]
Captain Mira always told me to keep[N]
my eyes on the enemy in front of me,[N]
so you should do that too, Iskra.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Please, I'm not so simple-minded[N]
that I can't recite a chant and[N]
keep track of who's in front of me.[AN]
Besides, I nearly know them by heart[N]
now, so I rarely read them as is.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, fair enough. I guess I looked[N]
at it like if it was me, but you're[N]
a heck of a lot smarter than I am.[AN]
I can barely read regular letters,[N]
so you're real impressive to me![AN]
Oh, looks like there's a soldier[N]
over there, so that's our cue.[AN]
Follow my lead, Iskra![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Wait, what?[A] Emil can't read?[AN]
I knew that he wasn't exactly[N]
well-educated, but this[Beat][N][CloseEyes]
What kind of scout can't read a sign?[N][OpenEyes]
Something has to be done about this![AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Iskra? What'd you come over here for?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Emil[Beat] Do you really not know?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Is this about the baklava?[AN]
I mean, I know I ate a lot,[N]
but you said it was okay, so-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Emil, I'm not going to strike up[N]
a conversation about pastries[N]
with enemies staring us down,[AN]
no matter how tasty they may be[N]
or how much of a pig you are.[AN]
[MidRight]
You do sound a little mad about it[Beat][N]
Well, then what's that look about?[AN]
You already know I'm not that smart,[N]
so don't expect me to read your mind.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Reading is the problem here, Emil![AN]
Specifically, you not being able[N]
to do it! I didn't notice at first,[AN]
but there are so many things that[N]
you can't do for us as a result.[AN]
For one, how do you properly plan[N]
routes for the army if you[N]
can't even read a map? Hm?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, I grew up on a farm, so we didn't[N]
need to study, and we couldn't afford it![AN]
I've been trying to learn ever since[N]
I joined the army, but it's tough stuff.[AN]
After a while here, Captain Mira[N]
said she'd handle all of that,[N]
and I could just do what I do best.[AN]
Riding around, spotting danger,[N]
and running back, I'm good at that,[N]
better than you or anyone else![AN]
If you wanna talk about weaknesses,[N]
what about you? You can barely ride[N]
a mount. Isn't that bad for a scout?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] Fine, you have a point.[AN]
I just don't think we should give up[N]
on improving ourselves and our skills,[N]
you know? And you're not dumb, either.[AN]
I know you can figure it out if you[N]
work hard and stick with it, Emil.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Alright, Iskra. If you help me get[N]
better at reading, then I'll show you[N]
a thing or two about horseback riding.[AN]
They're both pretty useful skills,[N]
I reckon, even after Cythes falls.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sounds good to me, Emil.[N]
Let's do our best![AN][X]

Hey, Iskra! That book learning of yours[N]
actually did me some good, after all.[AN]
Can't say I'm ready to read some of the[N]
tomes you've always got your nose in,[N]
but writing letters is pretty useful![AN]
The commanders seem real pleased now,[N]
since I can scratch out notes to pass[N]
on to other scouts and deliver 'em.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, "scratch" is an accurate way[N]
of putting it[Beat] Regardless, it's[N]
legible at least, which is enough.[AN]
You've made incredible progress[N]
in such a short time, Emil.[AN]
I can't commend you enough.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, shucks. You're doing great too![AN]
I never thought you'd get that good[N]
at horseback riding this quick,[N]
but you're not far behind me now.[AN]
Looks like you can finally keep up![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I wouldn't quite say that, but[N]
thank you anyway. Your lessons were[N]
more valuable than even I hoped.[AN]
I never truly realized how valuable[N]
a horse is on the battlefield[Beat][N]
But now, it's clear as day.[AN]
Why doesn't everyone ride horses[N]
if they're this useful in battle?[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, that's what I've always wondered,[N]
but I guess they just don't get it.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway, I can't wait to show off[N]
my new skills to my family back home.[AN]
We never needed to read on the farm,[N]
but now that I get it, it's way[N]
more useful than I thought![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah, right[Beat] You'll go back to Cythes[N]
when everything's over, right?[AN]
I'd almost forgotten, but[Beat][N]
I suppose we won't see each other much[N]
after the Liberators disband for good.[AN]
It's a shame. Despite any of our[Beat][N]
disagreements, we got along well.[AN]
There aren't many other people around[N]
our age in the Liberators, so it was[N]
nice to have a[Beat] a friend like you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Why are you acting like this is the end?[N]
We both can ride a horse real well, so[N]
why not take turns visiting each other?[AN][ToggleSmile]
My family lives close to the border,[N]
so it's not even that far a trip![AN]
A few weeks, or so[Beat] Probably.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, it isn't an impossible trek.[N]
Ah, that's right! We can write letters[N]
to keep up, even if we're far away.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm, sounds good. Though, it'd be nice[N]
to live closer to Decia to make seeing[N]
you easier[Beat] You and everyone, I mean![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I wouldn't mind that, but for now,[N]
let's work on your writing skills.[AN]
We'll have to if I'm meant to read[N]
much of anything outside of scouting[N]
instructions with any accuracy[Beat][A][X]
