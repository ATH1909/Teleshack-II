Hmm[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Can I help you, Ellerey?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah, it's nothing[N]
too important.[AN]
Your personal bow[N]
just intrigues me,[AN]
that's all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, I guess it[N]
is pretty special.[AN]
[MidRight]
Anyways, I'll be off[N]
for now.[AN]
I can't waste too much[N]
time in battle[AN]
fawning over a bow[N]
of all things.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmm, xe seems pretty[N]
intrigued by the[N]
Hounding Bow.[AN]
Maybe I'll teach xem[N]
the inner workings[N]
of my craft.[AN][X]

Hey, Ellerey?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You need somethin',[N]
Darby?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I thought I'd tell you[N]
about my bow.[AN]
Seems you were pretty[N]
interested last time.[AN]
[MidRight]
I did not wish to interrupt[N]
your aim,[AN]
but if you're gonna[N]
spill the beans,[AN]
I'd be happy to listen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Very well.[AN]
It is true that the Hounding[N]
Bow is one-of-a-kind.[AN]
It's a family heirloom,[N]
but it ain't no trophy.[AN]
But its meant to work[N]
best with arrows[AN]
designed to hunt[N]
game.[AN]
That's why it struggles[N]
against airborne targets[AN]
but makes quick work of[N]
those on grounded mounts.[AN]
Not to say that horses[N]
are game,[AN]
but you get the idea.[AN]
[MidRight]
So it's the arrows,[N]
not the bow.[AN]
How very intriguing[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Glad I could help you[N]
out, Ellerey.[AN]
Feel free to ask[N]
more anytime.[AN]
[MidRight]
I may just accept[N]
that offer, Darby.[AN][X]

Hello, Darby.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh, hey there,[N]
Ellerey.[AN]
Any more info you[N]
want today?[AN]
[MidRight]
Not exactly.[AN]
I want you to[N]
inspect this.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
An arrow?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
A special arrow.[AN]
Using what you've taught[N]
me about the Hounding Bow[AN]
and my knowledge of armor[N]
crushing due to The Breaker,[AN]
I made a new prototype arrow[N]
that could pierce armor[AN]
more efficiently than an[N]
ordinary break arc.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So, it's kinda like being[N]
able to shoot miniature Breakers?[AN]
Seems pretty nifty to me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course, it's just[N]
a test design.[AN]
I wanted to work with you[N]
on perfecting it.[AN]
And after that,[AN]
we may be able to[N]
expand beyond armor.[AN]
Blades that knock down[N]
fliers,[AN]
arrows that shred[N]
mages' robes[Beat][AN]
The possibilities[N]
are endless.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Seems like the best of[N]
both worlds for us.[AN]
I'd love to tag[N]
along, Ellerey![AN]
[MidRight]
Excellent.[AN]
I look forward to working[N]
with you, Darby.[AN][X]

That emblem on your[N]
armor[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, what's the big[N]
deal about it?[AN]
I'm not with Selese[N]
anymore, Jacinth.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, it's not that.[AN]
You've taken such[N]
good care of your armor,[AN]
yet the Selesian emblem[N]
hasn't been touched in a while.[AN]
It's all faded and[N]
chipped away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I was never in to what[N]
Selese wanted.[AN]
Now, if you'll stop[N]
probing,[AN]
I have a fight to win.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
My, what a mysterious person.[AN][X]

## EllereyJacinthB

[MidRight]
Hey, Ellerey![AN]
[MidLeft]
What now, Jacinth?[AN]
I'm not gonna tell you[N]
about my past with Selese.[AN]
That's a time best left[N]
in memory.[AN]
And it's a memory I'd[N]
love to make fade.[AN]
[MidRight]
What happened back[N]
then, Ellerey?[AN]
Please, I just want[N]
to help.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's no use, Jacinth.[AN]
Just please, leave[N]
me be.[AN][ClearFace]

Ellerey?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah![AN]
Oh, it's just you, Jacinth.[AN]
[MidRight]
That stare[Beat][AN]
Please, tell me, Ellerey.[AN]
It pains me to see[N]
you suffering like this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Fine.[AN]
My Selesian and Cythean[N]
superiors were[Beat][AN]
far from pleasant.[AN]
They promised me good work[N]
with my smithing skills.[AN]
But it was all just an exploit[N]
to treat me as no worse than a slave.[AN]
They stole my works and used[N]
me as cannon fodder.[AN]
Frankly, I'm surprised I'm[N]
still alive.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
T-that's awful[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I was slated to serve[N]
at the siege at Zykhra Gate,[AN]
where the Liberator-Freyse alliance[N]
surely would've brought my doom.[AN]
So I deserted.[AN]
[MidRight]
You are in the right, Ellerey.[AN]
You have no obligation to[N]
serve monsters like those.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's not all.[AN]
My hands are bloodied[Beat][AN]
When I left to join the Liberators[N]
at Castle Selese,[AN]
I encountered an old commander[N]
patrolling the woods.[AN]
He tried to treat me cordially[N]
as a ploy.[AN]
I retaliated by thrusting a[N]
lance in his heart.[AN]
I abhor murder, but my rage[N]
took over.[AN]
[MidRight]
I do not blame you[N]
at all, Ellerey.[AN]
If anything, he had[N]
it coming.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Jacinth[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'll protect you[N]
for now and forever, Ellerey.[AN]
I swear it.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Jacinth, I[Beat] I[Beat][AN][X]
