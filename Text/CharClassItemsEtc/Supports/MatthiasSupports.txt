E-Excuse me? Father? Do[N]
you have a moment?[A]
[MidRight]
Hmm? Ah[Beat] you're one of[N]
the healers, yes?[AN]
Yes, what can I help you with?[A]
[MidLeft]
Er[Beat]That's the thing.[N]
I[Beat]I want to be of more help.[AN]
My healing[Beat] isn't enough[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat]I'm not quite sure I follow.[AN]
Are you asking for[N]
tips with using staves?[AN]
From what I've seen, there's[N]
not much I can teach you[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
No, that's not it. I know I'm competent[N]
at healing, my patients say so[Beat][AN]
It's just- even though they thank me-[N]
I still- I mean I can't-it just[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat]never mind. This was stupid.[N]
I'm sorry for troubling you, Father[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Wait a moment-[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
That woman[Beat] her eyes hold such[N]
great sadness. I should see if there's[N]
some way I can help her[Beat][A][X]

Tippany![A]
[MidRight]
Father? Is something wrong?[A]
[MidLeft]
About our last conversation, you-[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Please, forget about it. Like I said,[N]
it was a mistake.[A]
[MidLeft]
I'm afraid I cannot, not when this is[N]
plainly causing you such anguish. [A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I have been thinking about why[N]
you approached me[Beat] [AN]
Is it because of the reputation I[N]
developed as someone who will[N]
listen to other's troubles?[AN]
That is, someone who is helpful?[N]
Wanted, even?[A]
[MidRight]
Yes, exactly! I-[Beat] I mean, yeah,[N]
that's it.[AN]
I want to be able to help[N]
people with troubles beyond[N]
battle wounds, that's all.[AN]
To be of more use, you know?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see. Certainly I could not[N]
dismiss someone who[N]
wishes to help others.[AN]
In my travels, I've found that[N]
even just listening, simple though[N]
it may be, is an art all its own.[AN]
Even if you don't wish to follow[N]
Byelen's creed, as I do, it's still[N]
a noble thing. [AN]
However[Beat][N]
that is what concerns me.[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat]I don't[Beat]get it.[N]
What's concerning about it,[N]
if it's noble?[AN]
I swear I'm not lying-[A]
[MidLeft]
Please don't misunderstand,[N]
Tippany. I can see that your [N]
desire to be of help is true. [AN]
However[Beat]you speak with [N]
such desperation about it. [AN]
The same goes for how you[N]
speak of your healing.[AN]
As I have said, I've developed[N]
something of a reputation as[N]
someone who will listen to,[AN]
and even help solve troubles.[AN]
I would be remiss if I did not[N]
extend the same to you.[AN]
Forgive me for overstepping,[N]
but is there some reason you[N]
feel such a need to be of aid? [AN]
To be relied on?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat]I can't[Beat] You wouldn't[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You need not answer me now.[A]
But I assure you, whatever you[N]
have to say, whenever it may be,[N]
I will listen, without judgement.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat]okay, Father.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I hope I said the right things to[N]
her[Beat] All I can do is wait and[N]
hope she comes to see me again.[A][X]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Father?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yes, Tippany?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I was thinking about what you[N]
said before[Beat] I think I'm ready.[AN]
To talk about it, I mean. 'Cause[N]
you were right that[Beat] there's[N]
a[Beat] reason that I became a healer,[AN]
that I want to do more to help.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I am listening. Please, speak freely.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat]I used to be part of an[Beat][N]
organization. Some would say cult.[AN]
I've[Beat] done a lot of bad things. I've[N]
hurt a[Beat]lot of people. [AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I-I mean, I stopped! I left that group[N]
behind, and since then, I[Beat]I've been[N]
been trying to make amends.[AN]
Became a healer. And, it's been good![N]
I can see that I'm making things better[N]
for everyone I help.[AN]
But[Beat] it's not enough.  I still[N]
feel that crushing darkness, no[N]
matter how many patients I take[Beat][AN]
I figured I needed to do more, so[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You came to me to ask for advice.[N]I understand now.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat]I know it's a weird thing to ask[N]
but[Beat]you said it was a noble thing,[N]
right?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I told you before that I would not dismiss[N]
someone who sought to aid others.[AN]
However[Beat] I will be blunt. [N]
Even if I did take you under my wing,[AN]
helped you hone your speech[N]
and you traveled as I do,[N]
it would not ease your pain one iota. [AN]
No matter how many people you heal,[N]
how many hearts you unburden,[N]
it would remain.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
W-What[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I do not know what crimes you have[N]
committed, nor if they are reparable.[AN]
But they are not debts you can pay for[N]
by doing good deeds, and your[N]
heart knows this.[AN]
It may even be the case there is nothing[N]
you will ever be able to do to undo the[N]
suffering you have inflicted.[AN]
Trying to pile penance upon[N]
your guilt will simply bury it,[N]
until it eats you from the inside out.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
T-Then[Beat]There's nothing I can do[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I apologize. I've given you a false impression.[N]
There is, indeed, something you can do.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But you said good deeds won't help![N]That there might be no way for me[N]
to undo the pain I've wrought![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
The crushing darkness you[N]
speak of is not that of your sins.[AN]
It is the pain you feel for having[N]
been someone who did sin.[AN]
You will never be able to change what[N]
actions you committed in the past.[AN]
The only way forward is for you to[N]
accept what mistakes you've made.[AN]
To feel remorse.[AN]
I will admit that this is not easy.[N]
It may take you a lifetime[N]
to come to terms with it.[A]
But the one thing I am absolutely[N]
sure of is that you will not heal your[N]
anguish by plying it with good deeds.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat]I see[Beat] It's all been about[N]
trying to ignore what I've done[Beat][N]
I've been so foolish, haven't I?[A]
[MidRight]
I wouldn't say that. Many problems[N]
are difficult to solve by one's self.[AN]
That's why people form communities,[N]
and lean on each other. And I'm happy[N]
to lend a shoulder.[AN]
You would hardly be the first person[N]
in this army to feel this sort of guilt,[N]
there are others I could direct you to.[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
T-Thank you, so much, Father![N]
I'll-I'll take great heed of your advice,[N]
I promise![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'm glad I could help.[A][X]
