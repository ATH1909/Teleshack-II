Your swings are looking sharp, Iskra.[N]
You've come a long way in a short[N]
amount of time. I'm impressed.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Mm. Although magic will always be[N]
my main method of attack, at least[N]
I have a good secondary option.[AN]
All thanks to my wonderful teacher![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha. Look, I may be harsh, but it's[N]
for your own good. Nobody's learned[N]
anything worthwhile without a struggle,[AN]
so I had to make sure you wouldn't[N]
give up at the first sign of adversity.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm, fair enough, but don't you know me[N]
better than that? I've never given up[N]
on anything, even when we were kids.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, you've always been annoyingly[N]
persistent. You threw a lot of tantrums[N]
as a tyke because of that stubborness.[AN]
One time, you even sword that you'd-[.4][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Not another word, Loewe.[N]
Don't say a damn thing.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Alright, alright. Moving on, then.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Anyway, I taught myself how to use[N]
magic with almost no help besides[N]
a dusty old tome about thunderstorms.[AN]
I think I can handle a sword when[N]
I've got an actual instructor.[AN]
[MidRight]
Still, learning Mahemeni swordsmanship[N]
is a bit different from reading a tome[N]
endlessly until you could practice magic.[AN]
It's more physically demanding, which[N]
has never been your strong suit.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It's not yours either, but you're[N]
clearly pretty good at this.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, and it took me years to get[N]
this far[Beat] Whatever. The point is,[N]
I've been just as strict as necessary.[AN]
If you keep on this pace, then all[N]
your talk about surpassing me may[N]
happen after all. I doubt it, though.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Doubt it all you want, I'm doing it.[AN]
I've gotta get some kind of payback[N]
for you one-upping me all these years.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, you've got your magic.[N]
Isn't that impressive enough?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]No, I've gotta beat you at your[N]
own game. That's the only way that[N]
I can show[Beat] Never mind, Loewe.[AN]
Forget it, we've got more important[N]
things to deal with right now. See ya![AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MidLeft][ClearFace][MidRight]
Huh, that's strange.[N]
Iskra was in a weird mood.[AN]
I wonder what she wanted to say[Beat][N]
Well, I'll just ask another time.[A][X]

## LoeweIskraASupport
[MidLeft][LoadIskra]
No wonder Mom never wanted to tell[N]
me who he was[Beat] I can't believe it.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
Iskra, what are you mumbling about?[N]
We can't lose focus mid-battle.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
AH! Oh, it's just you, Loewe.[N]
[Beat]Um, it's nothing, really.[N]
How are you holding up with[Beat] you know?[AN]
[MidRight]
My eye? Well, I've been better, clearly,[N]
but my aim's still good enough to fight.[AN]
Now, what were you talking about before?[AN]
You said it's "nothing," but I know you[N]
better than that. If you really don't[N]
want to tell me, then I'm fine with that,[AN]
but just know that I'm here to listen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, I don't mind telling you.[AN]
After we defeated[Beat] that thing[N]
using General Dragana's body,[N]
I found out who my father is.[AN]
Honestly, I should've been able[N]
to guess as much, since my mother[N]
was close to him before all this,[AN]
but I just didn't want to see it.[AN]
He's[Beat] Duke Cidor, of House Selese.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Then that makes you a noble?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Selese lands all belong to Decia[N]
now, so my status hasn't changed[N]
at all. I'm no more noble than you.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What's eating at you, then?[N]
Nothing's changed, as you said.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But I'm the child of a traitor now,[N]
aren't I? Not just any traitor, either.[AN]
Cidor's compliance doomed all of Decia[N]
to be stepping stones for the Cytheans.[AN]
Is there[Beat] a place for me here anymore?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, I can't speak for everyone.[AN]
It's possible that some Liberators[N]
would think less of you if they knew[N]
or try to force you out of the army.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]If that's the case, I-[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
But if anyone said that, I'd kick 'em[N]
out. You've fought just as hard and[N]
sacrificed just as much as anyone else.[AN]
I couldn't care less about your dad.[AN]
You're one of the best of us, Iskra,[N]
and losing you would be a huge blow.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Ha, you really mean it?[N]
That[Beat] That means a lot, Loewe.[AN]
Thanks. I won't doubt myself again![AN]
[MidRight]
Good. We need everybody we can[N]
get until this conflict's over[N]
and the Liberators finally disband.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Speaking of, what do you plan to do[N]
when we don't have to fight anymore?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I've considered settling in Mahemen.[AN]
Wustheim'll need plenty of people[N]
to rebuild it, and I still want[N]
to refine my swordsmanship further.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Coulda fooled me, given how good[N]
you look out there with a sword.[AN]
I still have a long way to go[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Well, if you've got nothing else[N]
to do, why not come with me?[AN]
We're not done with your lessons yet.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, you've got a point there.[AN]
Honestly, I only ever wanted to learn[N]
to fight to protect you and Mom[Beat][N]
but it's a part of me now.[AN]
If finishing my training will help[N]
protect the people I care about,[N]
then I'm all for it, Loewe.[AN]
Besides, I still have to surpass you![AN][X]

## Cromar_Loewe_C
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCromar][OpenMidRight][LoadLoewe]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]Huh? Cromar?[N]
What are you doing?[AN]
Also, you can call me Loewe.[N]
I don't need that title.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Your form could use work.[N]
I challenge you to a duel.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What!? Right here?[N]
You're daft, man![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What better backdrop to a duel[N]
than the sound of an epic battle[Beat][AN]
I can think of no place more appropriate[N]
to assess the skills of my commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?[N]
I told you to stay away from[N]
the front lines, anyway.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You fear the darkness that I call,[N]
and so you try to keep[N]
me in a pen like a dog.[AN]
But that darkness is only[N]
a manifestation of your fear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're not making any sense.[N]
Look, I'm not going to sit[N]
here and listen to this.[AN]
I'm not dueling you, end of story.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do you want to know how I see[N]
through the darkness I call?[N]
Do you, Loewe?[A]
[OpenMidRight]It would be a strategic advantage if we[N]
could see through the fog and mists.[N]
Especially if our enemies could not.[AN]
It would give us the upper hand in[N]
the many battles we've yet to have,[N]
against enemies of increasing strength.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Allow me to let you in on my secret.[N]
But, I will only relinquish it if you accept my[N]
challenge, Loewe. Fight me! A duel![A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]You'll get no fight, nor duel,[N]
but maybe a[Beat] casual spar?[AN]
Cleo would be livid if she saw us fighting[N]
for fun on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's your fear talking again.[N]
Your weakness[Beat] it's palpable.[AN]
You will only succeed if you learn[N]
of the secrets I house within the darkness.[AN]
You can choose to hide from it,[N]
but victory is found through it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Alright, alright. Enough with[N]
the cryptic rubbish.[AN]
I hear it enough from Kwame, anyway.[N]
Alright, it's a deal, Cromar.[AN]
This better be worth the time.[A][X]

## Cromar_Loewe_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCromar][OpenMidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Hrngh[Beat] how are you[N]
so[Beat] strong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not bad, Loewe.[N]
You lasted longer than I expected.[AN]
Not that I was expecting much[N]
from you to begin with.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]Is this really the time to[N]
be slinging insults?[AN]
I held up my end of the bargain.[N]
Cromar! Tell me the secret![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]The secret lies within the darkness.[N]
Truth is found by pressing forward,[N]
through any and all challenges.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That much I understood,[N]
but I don't quite understand what that[N]
actually means in practice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The sky[Beat] it darkens.[N]
Our duel has called forth the darkness.[N]
Look around you, Loewe.[AN]
The entire field of battle is shrouded[N]
in a thick fog. Will you retreat,[N]
or will you embrace the unknown?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose you're telling me I need[N]
to wander blindly into the fog, huh?[N]
Are you trying to get me killed?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If killing you would entertain me,[N]
I would've done it long ago.[N]
No, I believe in your cause, Loewe.[AN]
There is a reason I am here,[N]
but it, too, is obscured to you[N]
by the shadows you run from.[AN]
Now, I say to you, venture into the darkness[N]
and the answers of how to see through[N]
it will come to you! Go! Go now![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]Cromar! CROMAR![N]
Damn it all to hell, he's insane.[N]
This is legitimately ridiculous.[AN]
He left me here alone with only[N]
this blasted fog[Beat][N]
He's really trying to get me killed.[AN]
When this battle is over,[N]
I'm making sure we check references[N]
before we let anyone else into our army.[AN]
Well, I guess it's just me now[Beat][N]
I suppose I have no way to go but forward[N]
into the unknown.[AN]
[Beat][N]
[Beat][N]
[Beat] Hm? What's this, on the floor?[A][X]

## Cromar_Loewe_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCromar][OpenMidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenMidRight]Cromar, there you are.[N]
I've been searching for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, do you come to me seeking answers,[N]
or have you uncovered them yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Beyond the enemies that I had to[N]
face after you conveniently vanished,[AN]
there wasn't much of interest.[N]
Oddly enough, I did find this.[AN]
A bag full of assorted vegetables.[N]
It felt[Beat] strangely out of place.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is nutrition out of place for you, Loewe?[N]
Do you consider the impact of your diet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not sure what you mean.[N]
I mean, I like to think I eat decently.[AN]
But I can't say I think rigorously about[N]
everything I consume.[AN]
Sometimes you don't get a choice for what's[N]
served on your plate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's no attitude for a commander.[N]
A commander must eat well.[AN]
If the commander eats well, he leads well.[N]
He has the nourishment to go into battle.[AN]
Otherwise, he will grow weary before the[N]
battle is over and perish unceremoniously.[AN]
We cannot afford to have such a frail leader.[N]
You never allow yourself to rest, Loewe.[AN]
You take the field in every battle,[N]
indoor or outdoor, rain or shine.[AN]
It is one of the reasons I admire you.[N]
You are always with your troops.[AN]
But even if you feel like[N]
you must always fight,[AN]
you cannot maintain this[N]
if you don't eat right.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Are you really about to lecture me[N]
about food of all things!?[N]
What does this have to do with darkness!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Open the bag, Loewe.[N]
What is in there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Carrots, sweet potatoes, kale,[N]
and a[Beat] grapefruit?[AN]
They all look remarkably fresh, too.[N]
Cromar, where did you get these?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Focus on the task at hand.[N]
Do you know why I placed those there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let me guess, to make sure I[N]
keep up my strength? But there's no meat![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, but you wanted to see[N]
through darkness.[AN]
You can't punch it or pierce it[N]
with an arrow.[AN]
Brute strength comes from meat,[N]
but these fruits and vegetables[Beat][AN]
They will allow you to see through[N]
the darkest nights. The thickest fog.[AN]
These are good for your eyes, Loewe.[N]
Or perhaps, I should say eye.[AN]
Regardless, that only makes it more pressing.[N]
I'll be stopping by your tent with more later.[AN]
I expect you to eat all of them.[N]
No more breads, either.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]That's[Beat] I am not a child! Do you[N]
really think root vegetables and citrus[N]
are going to allow me to see better?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am living proof, Loewe.[N]
Doubt me, and you'll see the consequences.[N]
Or more realistically, you won't.[AN]
I told you, you're weak.[N]
Eat these. Rest well. Train well.[N]
Then you will know true strength.[AN]
You not only will have the eyes, but[N]
the fortitude to overcome the darkness.[N]
Otherwise, you will perish.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm[Beat] stupefied, honestly.[N]
You really think that a few vegetables[N]
will make the difference, huh?[AN]
I suppose you have a point. If all we eat are[N]
grains and meats[Beat] we miss out on a lot.[N]
Maybe there's something to this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Good. I'm glad you see it my way.[N]
Now then, I will provide more[N]
precise cooking instructions later.[AN]
For now, the battle. Farewell.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] I'm just glad he said I don't[N]
need to eat this sweet potato raw.[AN]
Still, my point on checking[N]
into new recruits remains.[A][X]

Yes, sir?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can tell you a bit,[N]
if you're really that curious.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am! Let's start with the food, then.[N]
What do Decians usually eat?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, it's hard to say. I've been a[N]
rebel for most of my life, and we[N]
don't exactly use the best ingredients.[AN]
Still, Decia has a wealth of good land[N]
for farming, so most of our dishes[N]
feature food straight from the farm.[AN]
What I'd do for a good apple pie[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
A [OpenQuote]pie?" What's that?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, you guys don't have those in[N]
Mahemen. It's too good for me[N]

Maybe I'll make it for you some time.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished][OneLineBox]
Ah, Asha. How are you holding up?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Same as always, I guess.[N]
[Beat]Saaay, commander.[N]
Wanna answer another question?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Just make it quick.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You got it! Well, I was wondering[N]
where you came from in Mahemen,[N]
the city or the country.[AN]
[MidRight]
I was born in Wustheim, so the city.[N]
My dad worked there as a scholar,[N]
poring through the Mahemeni Archives.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, my parents came from there too![AN]
So I'm told, anyway. Don't remember[N]
'em myself, so they're probably dead.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I'm sorry to hear that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't be, it doesn't bother me.[AN]
Miss Houvaina said that a lot[N]
of people lost their lives there,[N]
which makes me lucky to have survived.[AN]
[MidRight]
She's not wrong. I don't remember much[N]
of that night, but the screams[Beat][N]
I can still hear them, even now.[AN]
If me and my parents hadn't escaped[N]
the city that night, I don't know[N]
what would have happened to us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]What was Mahemen like back then?[N]
Before Cythes attacked, I mean.[AN]
I can't remember anything from then,[N]
but Miss Houvaina always looks sad[N]
when she talks about the old days.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] I was young too, so it's hard[N]
for me to say. My father always[N]
spoke fondly of his time there,[AN]
and of all the knowledge in Wustheim.[AN]
When Cythes arrived, many of those[N]
books and texts were hidden away.[AN]
Anything critical of the empire's past[N]
actions or thought to encourage revolt[N]
was burned to ashes, just like the city.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's horrible. I hate reading,[N]
but that doesn't mean they should've[N]
burned those books. It's not right.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's just one example of why we have[N]
to fight back against them, Asha.[AN]
Speaking of, let's get back to it.[N]

Ah, commander! I finally caught up[N]
to you. I wanted to ask something.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Sure, fire away.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well[Beat] we're getting close to the end,[N]
right? What do you plan on doing after?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] I've been thinking about it,[N]
but I'm not entirely sure yet.[N]
Why do you ask?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] Decia's pretty much free now,[N]
I think. It doesn't have any need[N]
for Liberators anymore, right?[AN]
So I was wondering, would you[N]
ever think about coming back home?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
To Mahemen? I've considered it,[N]
but Decia's my home, too.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, I get it. That apple pie was real[N]
good, so I see why you liked it there.[N]
But[Beat] I'll be lonely without you, sir.[AN]
Aside from Miss Houvaina, there aren't[N]
many people in the Sacred Arrow Rebels[N]
that I'm real close with.[AN]
[MidRight]
Really? You're so outgoing that[N]
I figured you were friends with[N]
half the army. Color me surprised.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, but[Beat] I don't know, I've never[N]
really been passionate about the cause.[N]
I don't remember things like you all do.[AN]
To me, the Mahemen we have now is all[N]
I've ever known, so it's hard to act[N]
like I'm personally mad about it all.[AN]
To tell you the truth, I'm only really[N]
here to repay Miss Houvaina's kindness.[AN]
When Cythes is finally done fighting us,[N]
I plan to leave and never look back.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I can't blame you for feeling[N]
that way. When I started out, all I[N]
could feel was rage against Cythes.[AN]
Now, though? I barely can remember[N]
how I felt the day my village burned.[N]
I just want all of this to be over.[AN]
But[Beat] even when it is, the damage[N]
Cythes has done won't just go away,[N]
so somebody has to pick up the pieces.[AN]
Trajan has Decia covered, and I'd[N]
bet that Cleo'll stay in Cythes[Beat][N]
Maybe I should go to Mahemen after all.[AN]
I was thinking that I could help rebuild[N]
Wustheim. It's my old home, and I'm[N]
sure the archbishops would welcome me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]If you really do want to go to[N]
Mahemen, then I'll go with you![N]
Er, if you'll let me, of course.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
When did you get so respectful?[N]
This isn't like you at all, Asha.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
H-Hey, I'm being serious here![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Alright, alright. Sure, come along if[N]
you like. Maybe those [OpenQuote]treasure hunting"[N]
skills of yours will prove useful.[AN]
There are plenty of secret passages[N]
in some of its buildings, I'd bet,[N]
along with many valuable relics.[AN]
If you can find some, I have a feeling[N]
that the archbishops would reward you.[AN]

Oh, Tao! Just who I was looking for.[N]
It's about the suppressive fire[N]
strategy we have planned.[AN]
Is your bow in good shape?[AN]
[MidLeft]
H-Huh? Oh, yeah. I've been adjusting[N]
it like you did every day for practice.[AN]
It works like a dream now.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]You've really grown, Tao. It wasn't[N]
too long ago that you could barely[N]
handle yourself on the battlefield.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha[Beat] Yeah, I was pretty weak,[N]
but your guidance has really helped.[AN]
I feel like I can take anyone on now![AN]
[MidRight]
Just don't let that get to your head.[AN]
Dragana always said that overconfidence[N]
spelled the end for any sniper. If[N]
someone reaches your perch, it's over.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
That was the reason for Mi's[N]
death, too[Beat] and almost my own.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
She thought that she could fight the[N]
Liberators and live, and so did I.[AN]
If you all hadn't spared me,[N]
then I would've died just like her.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No, I don't think she ever expected[N]
to survive. She wasn't like you, Tao.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Huh? What do you mean?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
She charged at us with no attempt of[N]
subtlety and no cover but an open[N]
field. No matter how many she killed,[AN]
there was never any chance of her[N]
doing that and living to tell the tale.[AN]
She wanted to die, and who can blame her?[AN]
Mifan[Beat] She must have watched as we[N]
cut down every last one of those[N]
villagers, ignorant to our sins.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]How can you speak as if you feel[N]
our pain when you perpetrated it?![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Heh, so I was right. That raised bow[N]
of yours means you haven't forgiven[N]
us after all. Not that I'm surprised.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
H-Huh? I[Beat] How long have you known?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Since I saw you in that port.[AN]
You can't hide your thirst for blood[N]
from me. I know what it looks like.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
My original reason for joining the[N]
Liberators had nothing to do with[N]
freeing Decia, or doing the right thing.[AN]
I just wanted to hurt Cythes, the same[N]
way they had hurt me. I would've done[N]
anything, even if it meant my own death.[AN]
That's why I could tell when I saw her[N]
that Mifan was the same as me.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]How did you move past that anger?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I found out that my mother survived,[N]
but that alone wasn't enough.[AN]
I realized something more important[N]
than that. No matter how many Cytheans[N]
I defeated, I never felt any better.[AN]
There is no end to a path of revenge.[AN]
Once I figured that out, my rage dulled,[N]
and all I could feel was[Beat] tired.[N]
Tired of this endless battle of ours.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What do you plan to do when it's over?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I planned on returning to my original[N]
home of Wustheim and helping clean it up.[AN]
The Sacred Arrow Rebels have only[N]
recently taken it back from Cythes,[N]
so there's a lot of work to be done.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Take me with you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, you're not gonna feather me?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]No, I want you to teach me.[AN]
You've got plenty of skills that[N]
I wish I had, so teach me them all.[AN]
Besides, killing you won't bring Mi back,[N]
and I want to see that you atone[N]
with my own two eyes. That a problem?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]No, that's fine by me. An apprentice[Beat][N]
That's got a nice ring to it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Please don't call me that.[A][X]

## LoeweCatrinASupport
[MidLeft][LoadCatrin][CloseEyes][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame[Beat] I thought we truly understood[N]
one another, as two who served the[N]
same lord. How[Beat] How could you?[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadLoewePunished][MoveFarRight][FarRight]
[Beat]It doesn't matter now, Mom.[AN]
He's standing in our way,[N]
so we have to deal with him.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][OpenEyes]
Loewe, there's no need to act tough[N]
around me. A mother can always tell.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No matter how I feel, it doesn't[N]
change what we have to do.[AN]
Kw[Beat] Cherne is our enemy now,[N]
and he's all that's in the way[N]
of a free, restored Orodreth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]If only it were that easy.[AN]
Killing one almighty being[N]
won't save everyone, Loewe.[AN]
Cythes still lies in tatters, and[N]
Chouwoujian warlords squabble over[N]
every bit of land they can gain.[AN]
Mahemen's resources lie depleted after[N]
years of warfare, and Decia is only[N]
now relearning what independence means.[AN]
There is much, much more to be done.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, I can't deny that, but there[N]
are plenty of determined people willing[N]
and ready to carry that burden.[AN]
Cleo in Cythes, Trajan in Decia[Beat][N]
myself in Mahemen, if they'll have me.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You plan to return to our home?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah. With Byelen gone, and the Sacred[N]
Arrow Rebels depleted, Mahemen's power[N]
structures are more unstable than ever.[AN]
If we can revitalize Wustheim, and[N]
replace the theocracy with something[N]
new, Mahemen can still weather the storm.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll help you in any way that I can.[AN]
Convincing people to change what[N]
they hold faith in won't be easy,[AN]
but Byelen existing within all of us[N]
will necessitate a change in worship.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]It'll be difficult to adjust to[N]
a godless world, but we have no choice.[AN]
Besides, no matter how difficult it[N]
may be, it can't be harder than[N]
what we've already done, right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I imagine very little could be, Loewe.[N]
[Beat]Oh, we should start with the archives![AN]
Your father loved studying there,[N]
and unearthing the knowledge that dwells[N]
within can only be good for Mahemen.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Yeah, that's a good idea.[AN]
Knowledge and faith[Beat] We'll have[N]
to make sure both of these needs[N]
are met in Mahemen's new order.[AN]
Hopefully, the archbishops can[N]
handle the coming religious shift.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm[Beat] I'll apologize to Lady Houvaina[N]
and Archibishop Kailani, as well.[AN]
If they'll accept it, then I intend[N]
to help make up for my actions however[N]
I'm able, no matter how long it takes.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sure they will, with time.[N]
First though, let's win this battle[N]
and pave a way to that future![AN][X]
