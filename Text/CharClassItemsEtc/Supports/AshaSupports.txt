[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsha][OpenMidRight][LoadOjasvi]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey there, Ojasvi, I gotta know something.[N]
Where did you get that necklace?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It was a gift from my father[N]
for my fourteenth birthday.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Must be nice to get such great[N]
gifts. Your family rich or something?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]R-rich?[N]
Well, I prefer wealthy, but-[AN]
No, I wouldn't consider us particularly[N]
more well-off than the average person.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Really? That necklace looks like it's[N]
made of some fine gold, Ojasvi.[AN]
Probably could sell that to feed a family[N]
bread for at least four months.[AN]
And not even bread cut with sawdust,[N]
I'm talking real, quality bread![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm afraid I don't know the[N]
necklace to bread conversion rate,[AN]
but I suppose I never[N]
did consider its value.[AN]
I got it when I was so young,[N]
it was just[Beat] something I owned.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, it's mighty nice all the same.[N]
Best keep it safe.[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat][A][X]

## Asha_Ojasvi_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsha][OpenMidRight][LoadOjasvi]
[OpenMidRight]Asha, don't you have any mementos?[N]
Or any sort of jewelry?[AN]
Surely, you have some kind of necklace,[N]
ring, bracelete, or bauble?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]None of the sort, Ojasvi.[N]
Guess I'm just not as rich as you.[AN]
Or, wealthy, as you prefer to put it.[N]
A little more of an ordinary life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Are you saying my life[N]
is extraordinary?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, certainly a bit more high-end[N]
than how I grew up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]How do you mean?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ojasvi, you can't be this dense![N]
Look at yourself![AN]
You're the daughter of a merchant with[N]
a famous last name. A surname![AN]
Do you know how rare those are?[N]
Those are for nobles, as far as I know.[AN]
Beyond that, you've got a fancy sword,[N]
studied in a foreign school,[AN]
and wear about four thousand gold[N]
just on your body![AN]
I hate to break it to you,[N]
but you're upper crust![A]
[OpenMidRight]But what difference does that make?[N]
I mean, I'm just like you.[AN]
I'm just part of this army[N]
like everyone else![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, maybe so, but you've[N]
gotta know you're pretty loaded![AN]
For example, I wouldn't want to walk[N]
around as you are in a dark alleyway,[AN]
or go to a pub dressed as you are.[AN]
You'll make yourself a target.[N]
You'll get hurt.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're all over the place.[N]
First, I'm wealthier than I claim,[AN]
now I am too weak to care for myself?[N]
Asha, what are you getting at?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You know what, forget it.[N]
Don't die out there, Ojasvi.[A][X]

## Asha_Ojasvi_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAsha][OpenMidRight][LoadOjasvi]
[OpenMidRight]Asha.[N]
Are you doing okay?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? Ojasvi?[N]
Your necklace[Beat] it's missing![AN]
Do you need help finding it?[N]
I'm sure I could find it real quick, and-[A]
[OpenMidRight]Asha, it's fine.[N]
I sold it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You sold your father's necklace?[N]
Why would you do that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I was turning over what you said.[N]
You're right, I'm more fortunate than most.[AN]
I was born into a rich family and was[N]
afforded many opportunities because of it.[AN]
I get that life isn't fair,[AN]
but I also don't need all[N]
of what I have now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]So, what did you do with the[N]
gold you received?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I bought food for everyone in[N]
the last village we were in.[AN]
I figured that if our army was going[N]
to be doing damage,[AN]
we'd best give a little extra food[N]
to the villagers to ensure they can eat.[AN]
They didn't ask to be part of the war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's[Beat] very kind of you.[AN]
Don't you care about[N]
the memory of it though?[AN]
I recognize it's valuable, but[Beat][N]
your father, he bought it for you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've had that for almost ten years,[N]
I can still picture it if I close my eyes.[AN]
I'm not worried about the sentimental[N]
value of the necklace anymore.[AN]
I'd rather use what I have for good.[N]
At least, if I can.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know, that gives me an idea.[N]
With my skills and your connections[Beat][AN]
I may have something we can do together[N]
after this is all over.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Together? Tell me more, Asha.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]All in due time, Ojasvi.[N]
All I know is that Miss Houvaina[Beat][AN]
She would be proud of it.[N]
But we can talk more later.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[Beat] okay![N]
I look forward to it.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]In the meantime, don't go selling[N]
the clothes off your back to feed folks.[AN]
You'll get cold in Cythes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Something I know all too well.[N]
Let's chat more later, then.[A][X]
