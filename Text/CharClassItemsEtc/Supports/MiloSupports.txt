[OpenMidLeft]Well, look at you![N]
Aren't you one large lad![AN]
And you move so nimbly, too.[N]
Tell me, how do you do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My size is hereditary.[N]
My parents' builds were impressive.[AN]
My movement[Beat] that was learned.[N]
A feat of much practice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Nothing encumbers you![N]
You just move right through,[N]
like a knife through warm butter.[AN]
What I'd give to be able to move[N]
like that! I am stiff as a board![N]
I'm lucky they even let me fight anymore![A]
[OpenMidRight]We are fighting for the same cause,[N]
are we not? Perhaps I can teach[N]
you some of what I've learned.[AN]
However, I am warning you.[N]
I am in search of a rare plant.[N]
I will require funds to continue it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]It's a deal![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMilo][OpenMidRight][LoadPelecaye]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, Pelecaye.[N]
Here you go.[AN]
I've scraped together a payment.[N]
It's a little non-traditional.[AN]
You said you liked plants,[N]
so I got you a bouquet of flowers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[Beat] I, um[Beat][N]
They're very nice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]They're peonies![N]
I bet you know all about peonies.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I seldom spend time concerning[N]
myself with such pedestrian flora, but-[AN]
No, they're lovely.[N]
Thank you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And look, I even threw in a few[N]
gold pieces and a piece of cake.[AN]
I baked the cake myself![N]
I hope it's to your liking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Cake and[Beat] forty-three gold?[N] 
Hm, most interesting.[AN]
You're right, your payment is non-traditional.[N]
I suppose it will do for the lesson[AN]
I will teach you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yippee![N]
I'm going to move and groove, now![AN]
I'll be the most feared[N]
soldier in the army.[AN]
Gwa ha ha! Yes![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadMilo][OpenMidRight][LoadPelecaye]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]This training is brutal, Pelecaye.[N]
I have more respect for you now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If that cake you prepared wasn't so[N]
light and fluffy, we wouldn't still be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Maybe we can take a break[N]
from trying to improve my movement,[AN]
and instead switch to me teaching you[N]
about cakes. I know a lot, I swear![A]
[OpenMidRight]I told you I'd fill my end of the bargain.[N]
The gold you gave me has already helped me.[AN]
I was able to pay a botanist to help me.[N]
This plant[Beat] I will find it![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What even is this danged plant?[N]
What could be so great about a plant!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]There's no time to question me, Milo.[N]
We've stopped for too long.[AN]
Let's try again. Lift your legs.[N]
Bend at the knees.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Graaagh I feel regret![N]
I yield! Just lay me to rest already![A][X]
