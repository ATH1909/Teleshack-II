## Zwieback_Filone_B
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadFilone]
[MidLeft]Filone, I'm impressed by your[N]
shooting. You've improved greatly.[A]
[MidRight]Thanks, Dad.[N]
But I can't help but feel like[Beat][AN]
No, never mind me.[N]
Forget it.[A]
[MidLeft]What's on your mind, dear?[N]
You can tell me.[A]
[MidRight]It's just[Beat] I can't help but think.[N]
When a fresh enemy approaches,[AN]
your attacks are ferocious,[N]
while my bow wavers.[AN]
But when they're all wounded,[N]
barely hangin' on,[AN]
that's when I hit my peak.[N]
My hands stop shaking, and[AN]
my shots get so strong it's scary,[N]
but that's when you show them mercy.[AN]
Why is it like this, Dad?[A]
[MidLeft]I got no clue, kiddo.[N]
I try not to think too much.[AN]
What's most important is that[N]
you're safe.[AN]
If that means I tend to hit more[N]
of my shots when the enemy is[AN]
chargin' at us at full strength,[N]
and less when they're not a threat,[AN]
then[Beat] that's just how it is.[A]
[MidRight]But why[Beat] why am I so much[N]
stronger when the enemy is near death?[AN]
I'm kicking 'em when they're down.[N]
Doesn't that make me a[Beat] monster?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]That's war, Filone.[N]
We kill, or we get killed. Ain't no use[N]
in worrying about how we do the killin'.[A]
[MidRight]I[Beat] Maybe that's true,[N]
Dad, but still[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][Beat]I forget she's still so young.[N]
Maybe I was too blunt for her[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
Linda[Beat] what should I do[N]
for this daughter of ours?[A][X]

## Zwieback_Filone_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadFilone]
[MidLeft]Filone, are you okay?[N]
You've been quiet lately.[AN]
Your meals get cold before[N]
you finish 'em, if you even bother to.[AN]
What's on your mind?[N]
Please, talk to me.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Dad, I can't stop thinking about it.[N]
About my mysterious cruelty.[AN]
I feel like I've been cursed,[N]
'cause no matter how hard I try[N]
to hold back, it doesn't work.[AN]
I've seen men crawling, begging me[N]
for life, and yet I can't stop[N]
my arrows from piercing through them.[AN]
Their screaming,[N]
the swish of arrows through flesh,[N]
that thud of them falling over dead[Beat][AN]
I hear it all the time, whether I'm[N]
awake or dreaming. It never stops![Beat][AN]
Dad, I[Beat]Is this just how it is?[N]
Will it always be like this?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're[Beat] really going through[N] 
a lot, aren't you, kiddo?[AN]
[Beat]I'd be lyin' if I said that feeling[N]
will ever fully washed away,[AN]
and I just don't know why your shots[N]
are so much stronger in those situations.[AN]
Your father just ain't that smart.[AN] 
I'm sorry. Maybe the gods know.[AN]
If you wanna leave, Filone,[N]
I won't stop you.[AN]
My duty as a father is to protect[N]
you, and I've failed utterly.[AN]
Your body might be safe and sound,[AN]
but what's the point if your head's[N]
stuck in all this sadness?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'd be lyin' if I said I hadn't[N]
thought about it. Leavin', I mean.[AN]
Try and give my head a break[N]
from all of this.[AN]
See if I can get away from all[N]
this death that's[N]
followin' me everywhere[Beat][AN]
But if what you say is right,[N]
then there ain't no point.[N]
No way I can outrun this.[AN]
I'd be alone with the screaming, Dad.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]Filone[Beat][N]
If you said the word,[AN]
I'd abandon my armor[N]
and toss aside my bow.[AN]
We could start all over.[N]
Go live somewhere far away,[N]
like in the mountains.[A]
[MidRight]
But it's like you've told me over the years.[N]
[OpenQuote]Soldiers have a duty, Filone.[AN]
Soldiers support their liege lord,[N]
and go wherever they may take them,[AN]
clinging to the hope they may[N]
someday return back to their home,[AN]
and that they may someday find peace."[N]
I've been thinking about that a lot too.[A]
[MidLeft]
Huh, that does sound like something[N]
I'd say, don't it?[AN]
[MidRight]Well, yeah! You and mother always[N]
had the same old sayings![AN]
I knew what y'all would say to[N]
me before even sayin' it![AN]
It was so predictable.[AN]
But[Beat] I guess[N]
it was also comforting.[A]
[MidRight]Yeah. Those were good times.[N]
While your mother may be gone,[AN]
and while war will change us,[N]
we must still cling to hope.[AN]
Hope that although our innocence[N]
has left us in war,[AN]
that afterwards[Beat][N]
we can someday feel at ease again.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Then[Beat] let's keep fighting, Dad.[N]
We can go to the mountains[N]
when it's all over.[AN]
I can think of a lot of things[N]
that would be easier than this,[N]
but we can't stop yet.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]You've grown into a strong woman.[N]
I'm grateful to call you my daughter.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]Dad[Beat][A][X]
