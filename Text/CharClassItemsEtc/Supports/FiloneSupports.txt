## Zwieback_Filone_B
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadFilone]
[MidLeft]Filone, I'm impressed by your[N]
shooting. You've improved greatly.[A]
[MidRight]Thanks, Dad.[N]
But I can't help but feel like[Beat][AN]
No, never mind me.[N]
Forget it.[A]
[MidLeft]What's on your mind, dear?[N]
You can tell me.[A]
[MidRight]It's just[Beat] I can't help but think.[N]
When a fresh enemy approaches,[AN]
your attacks are ferocious,[N]
while my bow wavers.[AN]
But when they're all wounded,[N]
barely hangin' on,[AN]
that's when I hit my peak.[N]
My hands stop shaking, and[AN]
my shots get so strong it's scary,[N]
but that's when you show them mercy.[AN]
Why is it like this, Dad?[A]
[MidLeft]I got no clue, kiddo.[N]
I try not to think too much.[AN]
What's most important is that[N]
you're safe.[AN]
If that means I tend to hit more[N]
of my shots when the enemy is[AN]
chargin' at us at full strength,[N]
and less when they're not a threat,[AN]
then[Beat] that's just how it is.[A]
[MidRight]But why[Beat] why am I so much[N]
stronger when the enemy is near death?[AN]
I'm kicking 'em when they're down.[N]
Doesn't that make me a[Beat] monster?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]That's war, Filone.[N]
We kill, or we get killed. Ain't no use[N]
in worrying about how we do the killin'.[A]
[MidRight]I[Beat] Maybe that's true,[N]
Dad, but still[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][Beat]I forget she's still so young.[N]
Maybe I was too blunt for her[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
Linda[Beat] what should I do[N]
for this daughter of ours?[A][X]

## Zwieback_Filone_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadFilone]
[MidLeft]Filone, are you okay?[N]
You've been quiet lately.[AN]
Your meals get cold before[N]
you finish 'em, if you even bother to.[AN]
What's on your mind?[N]
Please, talk to me.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Dad, I can't stop thinking about it.[N]
About my mysterious cruelty.[AN]
I feel like I've been cursed,[N]
'cause no matter how hard I try[N]
to hold back, it doesn't work.[AN]
I've seen men crawling, begging me[N]
for life, and yet I can't stop[N]
my arrows from piercing through them.[AN]
Their screaming,[N]
the swish of arrows through flesh,[N]
that thud of them falling over dead[Beat][AN]
I hear it all the time, whether I'm[N]
awake or dreaming. It never stops![Beat][AN]
Dad, I[Beat]Is this just how it is?[N]
Will it always be like this?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're[Beat] really going through[N] 
a lot, aren't you, kiddo?[AN]
[Beat]I'd be lyin' if I said that feeling[N]
will ever fully washed away,[AN]
and I just don't know why your shots[N]
are so much stronger in those situations.[AN]
Your father just ain't that smart.[AN] 
I'm sorry. Maybe the gods know.[AN]
If you wanna leave, Filone,[N]
I won't stop you.[AN]
My duty as a father is to protect[N]
you, and I've failed utterly.[AN]
Your body might be safe and sound,[AN]
but what's the point if your head's[N]
stuck in all this sadness?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'd be lyin' if I said I hadn't[N]
thought about it. Leavin', I mean.[AN]
Try and give my head a break[N]
from all of this.[AN]
See if I can get away from all[N]
this death that's[N]
followin' me everywhere[Beat][AN]
But if what you say is right,[N]
then there ain't no point.[N]
No way I can outrun this.[AN]
I'd be alone with the screaming, Dad.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]Filone[Beat][N]
If you said the word,[AN]
I'd abandon my armor[N]
and toss aside my bow.[AN]
We could start all over.[N]
Go live somewhere far away,[N]
like in the mountains.[A]
[MidRight]
But it's like you've told me over the years.[N]
[OpenQuote]Soldiers have a duty, Filone.[AN]
Soldiers support their liege lord,[N]
and go wherever they may take them,[AN]
clinging to the hope they may[N]
someday return back to their home,[AN]
and that they may someday find peace."[N]
I've been thinking about that a lot too.[A]
[MidLeft]
Huh, that does sound like something[N]
I'd say, don't it?[AN]
[MidRight]Well, yeah! You and mother always[N]
had the same old sayings![AN]
I knew what y'all would say to[N]
me before even sayin' it![AN]
It was so predictable.[AN]
But[Beat] I guess[N]
it was also comforting.[A]
[MidRight]Yeah. Those were good times.[N]
While your mother may be gone,[AN]
and while war will change us,[N]
we must still cling to hope.[AN]
Hope that although our innocence[N]
has left us in war,[AN]
that afterwards[Beat][N]
we can someday feel at ease again.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Then[Beat] let's keep fighting, Dad.[N]
We can go to the mountains[N]
when it's all over.[AN]
I can think of a lot of things[N]
that would be easier than this,[N]
but we can't stop yet.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]You've grown into a strong woman.[N]
I'm grateful to call you my daughter.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]Dad[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]Man, this is real scary.[N]
Pa always told me how tense a real[N]
fight is, but I didn't get it.[AN]
Not til now. [OpenQuote]All it takes is one[N]
second of lost focus, and[Beat]"[N]
Is that a pegasus flying above me?[AN]
Ah heck, I gotta shoot it down![AN]
I'm real sorry, mister pegasus,[N]
but it ain't nothing personal![A]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveMidRight]
[FarFarLeft][LoadTobie][TwoLineBox]
What do you think you're shooting at,[N]
Filone? I'm on your side, dolt![AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
H-Huh? Oh, is that you, Tobie?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course, who else could it be?[AN]
Do I look like some random mook[N]
on the enemy's side to you?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, not really, but[Beat][N]
When you're that high up,[N]
it's kinda hard to tell.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Fair enough, but even so,[N]
you shouldn't shoot at someone[N]
if you're not sure who they are.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's[Beat] Yeah, you're right.[N]
I just got scared, seein'[N]
you up there above me.[AN]
Pa warned me about them flying[N]
pegasi and dragons, and how[N]
they'd charge at you real fast.[AN]
That's why you gotta shoot 'em down,[N]
before they get too close to reach.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Your dad's advice is sound,[N]
but still, be more cautious.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway, I'm going back up.[N]
Don't shoot at me this time.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Ah, heck[Beat][N]
I hope she's not mad at me.[A][X]

## FiloneTobieBSupport
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Today's nice and quiet.[N]
Maybe I'm startin' to get used[N]
to all this fightin', after all.[AN]
Still, I hope it's all over soon.[AN]
I feel like[Beat] I'm losin' somethin'[N]
with each person that I feather[N]
with my arrows. Somethin' important.[AN]
[Beat]Wait, there's a pegasus above me![AN]
Should I shoot? Wait, no[Beat][N]
That's Tobie up there.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadTobie][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
Well, that's better than last time.[N]
Don't think I didn't see you[N]
drawing back your bowstring, though.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey, I'm learnin', alright?[AN]
Anyway, what'd you come down for?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, right[Beat] I wanted to ask[N]
you something, actually.[N]
You're new to the Liberators, right?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, I guess so. My pa's been around[N]
for a long time, but he didn't let[N]
me join til just this year, y'see.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I see. Then how do you have[N]
such a[Beat] killer instinct?[N]
It's unnatural for a novice.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Look, take it from me. I haven't[N]
been fighting for the Liberators[N]
much longer than you, Filone.[AN]
But that glint in your eye[N]
when you're going for the kill[Beat][N]
It scares me a little bit.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's not a question I can[N]
answer, Tobie. I know what[N]
you're talkin' about, but[Beat][AN]
I'm not thinkin' about much[N]
of anything when that happens.[N]
Just my survival, nothin' else.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
So it's subconscious?[AN]
[Beat]Well, I'm glad you're[N]
on our side, Filone.[AN]
I wouldn't want an archer like you[N]
staring me down on the other side.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Am I really that scary?[N]
All because I have a good shot?[AN]
Maybe[Beat] Maybe this isn't for me.[N]
I just wanted a normal life[Beat][A][X]

[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][LoadTobie]
Huh, that's strange.[N]
You didn't notice me, for once.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Oh, Tobie? Sorry, I was[N]
thinkin' about something.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You were thinking so hard that you[N]
couldn't tell I was right next to you?[AN]
If so, you probably shouldn't be[N]
doing that on the battlefield.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Yeah, I guess so, but to tell[N]
you the truth, I did see you comin'.[AN]
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't[N]
overlook someone gettin' near me.[AN]
We've been fightin' so long that[N]
my instincts won't go away,[N]
even when I'm not in any danger.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, why do you sound sad about that?[AN]
Isn't being ready for any enemy that[N]
may come your way a good thing?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Say, Tobie. What'd you sign up[N]
for when you joined the Liberators?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh? What's that got to do[N]
with what I asked you?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
C'mon, just tell me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Fine. Of course, like everyone[N]
else, I wanted to see a free Decia.[AN]
But even more than that?[AN]
I was[Beat] happy to be a part[N]
of something so important.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]For me, I wanted to help protect[N]
my pa, after he'd done so much for me.[AN]
But now, after bein' around real war,[N]
I[Beat] I can't wait to be done with it.[AN]
With each arrow I shoot, there's this[N]
growin' weight pullin' me down.[N]
It's too much for me to handle.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What do you plan to do after, then?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I dunno. Maybe go on a mountain,[N]
and get away from all this.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I've got a better idea. I've been[N]
meaning to explore the continent,[N]
but it's better to have a partner.[AN]
What do you say to coming with me?[AN]
You've proven reliable throughout[N]
all this, and I think a change[N]
of pace would be good for you.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'll have to think about it.[N]
For now, let's just focus on[N]
the battles ahead of us, okay?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sounds good to me. Make sure[N]
you have that bow pointed[N]
in the right direction, Filone![A][X]
