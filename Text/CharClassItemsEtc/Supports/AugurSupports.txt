Howdy![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Ah.[A][N]
I[Beat] see a vision of you.[A][N]
A rocky valley, and a[N]
sky dark with arrows[Beat][A][N]
No, that must be your[Beat] past[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Are you all right, miss?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I believe I am, yes.[A][N]
I have not seen you in this[N]
army before. Who might you be?[A]
[MidLeft]
My name is Rashid, but[N]
some call me the Sidewinder.[A][N]
What's your name?[A]
[MidRight]
I am called the Augur[Beat][A][N]
No, that is not what you asked[N]
for. My name is Reinhilde.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well then, it's nice[N]
to meet you, Reinhilde.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What was that thing you said[N]
earlier about a vision of me?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It is[Beat] a curse, placed[N]
upon me by the whims of Byelen.[A][N]
When I look upon people, I can[N]
sometimes see[Beat] glimpses, of[N]
the paths their life might walk.[A][N]
But with you, my visions only[N]
granted me a look into your past.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]That's[Beat] probably just[N]
some sort of weird coincidence.[A][N]
You[Beat] don't need to worry about it.[A][N]
Let's get back to the battle,[N]
Reinhilde! I'll cover your back.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That Rashid[Beat][A][N]
If his vision was of the past,[N]
then who were those people?[A][N]
What was it I saw[Beat]?[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Hey there, Reinhilde, right?[N]
I brought you something.[A]
[MidRight]
Ah, young Rashid. Is[N]
that[Beat] a cup of tea?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yeah. I brewed it myself![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
To give to me?[A]
That is[Beat] very kind of[N]
you. Thank you, greatly.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]It's no trouble at all![A][N]
I'm always happy to[N]
help out my friends.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile][Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Well? What do you think?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]This strong herbal flavor[Beat][N]
the beautiful flickering color[Beat][A][N]
This is truly an interesting[N]
and unique cup of tea.[A][N]
Wherever did you learn[N]
how to brew it, Rashid?[A]
[MidLeft]
This tea leaf blend is called[Beat][A][N]
uh[Beat][A] I forget the name.[A][N]
It was Rodney's favorite.[N]
He taught me how to make it.[A]
[MidRight]
Who is this Rodney,[N]
that I might thank him?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]An old friend of[N]
mine. Nothing more.[A]
[MidRight]
The hesitation in your[N]
voice[Beat] Very well.[A][N]
You don't have to speak of[N]
him if you don't want to.[A][N]
[Beat]But there is much tragedy[N]
I've seen in my many years.[A][N]
[Beat]If such a sorrowful story[N]
lurks behind your hesitation,[A][N]
know that in me, Rashid,[N]
you'll find an open ear.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you. Perhaps another time.[A][X]

[Beat]Reinhilde.[A]
[MidRight]
Rashid? Is that smell[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I brought you another[N]
cup of Rodney's tea.[A][N]
[Beat]And I thought while[N]
we drank it together,[A][N]
I could[Beat] could talk to[N]
you about who he was.[A][N]
[Beat]I doubt anyone else[N]
here would understand.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thank you, Rashid. Please,[N]
whenever you're ready[Beat][A][N]
tell your story.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Rodney was my twin[N]
brother and dearest friend,[A][N]
and a comrade in arms in the[N]
Reclamation Wars, millennia ago.[A][N]
On one fateful mission, Hamdi[N]
sent our squadron to distract[N]
a massive enemy legion[Beat][A][N]
We were pinned down in a[N]
rocky valley, surrounded by[N]
enemy archers on all sides.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I loosed my bow, the Archival,[N]
until my quiver was empty of[N]
arrows, but it was not enough.[A][N]
When their retaliation volley[N]
came, we had no cover. Their[N]
arrows blotted out the sky.[A][N]
Rodney was alone and terrified,[N]
standing just besides me.[A][N]
I threw myself over him as[N]
the arrows fell, sacrificing[N]
my life as a human shield[Beat][A][N]
when next I woke up, it was[N]
as a spirit in the present day,[A][N]
standing in the Temple of[N]
Colossus at Hamdi's side.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Those visions[Beat] now I[N]
understand what they were.[A][N]
I[Beat] I'm so sorry, Rashid.[A][N]
Did Rodney escape, at least,[N]
thanks to your sacrifice?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I don't know.[A][N]
Even if he did somehow survive,[N]
both that battle and the rest[N]
of the Reclamation Wars,[A][N]
he would have succumbed to[N]
his own age long, long ago.[A][N]
[Beat]And he was a common soldier,[N]
a man of no real consequence[N]
to those who write history.[A][N]
No history books or great chronicles[N]
would even remember his name.[A][N]
My dear, innocent brother[Beat][A][N]
Forever, he lies forgotten.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I know your pain, Rashid.[A][N]
A past none care to remember[Beat] it's[N]
a tragedy just as painful as watching[N]
its suffering happen the first time.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]As long as at least some[N]
of us who still live on[N]
don't forget the dead[Beat][A][N]
then they still live[N]
on in our hearts.[A][N]
We can still tell their story[N]
to any who will listen. As[N]
long as they're remembered[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I don't know how long[N]
I'll remain here for.[A][N]
I was summoned from nothingness[N]
to fight the Decian Liberators[Beat][A][N]
who knows when I will return there?[A][N]
In my stead, Reinhilde[Beat] can[N]
you carry on the story of Rodney?[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat][A][N]
I am an old woman.[A][N]
Not as old as you, I[N]
suppose, but still old.[A][N]
The end of my life[N]
draws near as well.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But together, we can tell[N]
many others in the world[N]
of those we have lost.[A][N]
Let me promise this to you, Rashid.[A][N]
No matter what it costs,[N]
even the rest of my life[Beat][N]
I will help you.[A][N]
I will help you make sure[N]
Rodney's story does not fade[N]
into the mists of memory.[A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]thank you, Reinhilde.[N]
Thank you, so, so much.[A][N]
To have even one person who[N]
understands, and is willing[N]
to remember alongside me[Beat][A][N]
You are truly a friend just[N]
as dear as Rodney ever was.[A][X]
