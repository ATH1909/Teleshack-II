Howdy![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Ah.[A][N]
I[Beat] see a vision of you.[A][N]
A rocky valley, and a[N]
sky dark with arrows[Beat][A][N]
No, that must be your[Beat] past[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Are you all right, miss?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I believe I am, yes.[A][N]
I have not seen you in this[N]
army before. Who might you be?[A]
[MidLeft]
My name is Rashid, but[N]
some call me the Sidewinder.[A][N]
What's your name?[A]
[MidRight]
I am called the Augur[Beat][A][N]
No, that is not what you asked[N]
for. My name is Reinhilde.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well then, it's nice[N]
to meet you, Reinhilde.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What was that thing you said[N]
earlier about a vision of me?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It is[Beat] a curse, placed[N]
upon me by the whims of Byelen.[A][N]
When I look upon people, I can[N]
sometimes see[Beat] glimpses, of[N]
the paths their life might walk.[A][N]
But with you, my visions only[N]
granted me a look into your past.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]That's[Beat] probably just[N]
some sort of weird coincidence.[A][N]
You[Beat] don't need to worry about it.[A][N]
Let's get back to the battle,[N]
Reinhilde! I'll cover your back.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That Rashid[Beat][A][N]
If his vision was of the past,[N]
then who were those people?[A][N]
What was it I saw[Beat]?[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Hey there, Reinhilde, right?[N]
I brought you something.[A]
[MidRight]
Ah, young Rashid. Is[N]
that[Beat] a cup of tea?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yeah. I brewed it myself![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
To give to me?[A]
That is[Beat] very kind of[N]
you. Thank you, greatly.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]It's no trouble at all![A][N]
I'm always happy to[N]
help out my friends.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile][Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Well? What do you think?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]This strong herbal flavor[Beat][N]
the beautiful flickering color[Beat][A][N]
This is truly an interesting[N]
and unique cup of tea.[A][N]
Wherever did you learn[N]
how to brew it, Rashid?[A]
[MidLeft]
This tea leaf blend is called[Beat][A][N]
uh[Beat][A] I forget the name.[A][N]
It was Rodney's favorite.[N]
He taught me how to make it.[A]
[MidRight]
Who is this Rodney,[N]
that I might thank him?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]An old friend of[N]
mine. Nothing more.[A]
[MidRight]
The hesitation in your[N]
voice[Beat] Very well.[A][N]
You don't have to speak of[N]
him if you don't want to.[A][N]
[Beat]But there is much tragedy[N]
I've seen in my many years.[A][N]
[Beat]If such a sorrowful story[N]
lurks behind your hesitation,[A][N]
know that in me, Rashid,[N]
you'll find an open ear.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you. Perhaps another time.[A][X]

[Beat]Reinhilde.[A]
[MidRight]
Rashid? Is that smell[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I brought you another[N]
cup of Rodney's tea.[A][N]
[Beat]And I thought while[N]
we drank it together,[A][N]
I could[Beat] could talk to[N]
you about who he was.[A][N]
[Beat]I doubt anyone else[N]
here would understand.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thank you, Rashid. Please,[N]
whenever you're ready[Beat][A][N]
tell your story.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Rodney was my twin[N]
brother and dearest friend,[A][N]
and a comrade in arms in the[N]
Reclamation Wars, millennia ago.[A][N]
On one fateful mission, Hamdi[N]
sent our squadron to distract[N]
a massive enemy legion[Beat][A][N]
We were pinned down in a[N]
rocky valley, surrounded by[N]
enemy archers on all sides.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I loosed my bow, the Archival,[N]
until my quiver was empty of[N]
arrows, but it was not enough.[A][N]
When their retaliation volley[N]
came, we had no cover. Their[N]
arrows blotted out the sky.[A][N]
Rodney was alone and terrified,[N]
standing just besides me.[A][N]
I threw myself over him as[N]
the arrows fell, sacrificing[N]
my life as a human shield[Beat][A][N]
when next I woke up, it was[N]
as a spirit in the present day,[A][N]
standing in the Temple of[N]
Colossus at Hamdi's side.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Those visions[Beat] now I[N]
understand what they were.[A][N]
I[Beat] I'm so sorry, Rashid.[A][N]
Did Rodney escape, at least,[N]
thanks to your sacrifice?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I don't know.[A][N]
Even if he did somehow survive,[N]
both that battle and the rest[N]
of the Reclamation Wars,[A][N]
he would have succumbed to[N]
his own age long, long ago.[A][N]
[Beat]And he was a common soldier,[N]
a man of no real consequence[N]
to those who write history.[A][N]
No history books or great chronicles[N]
would even remember his name.[A][N]
My dear, innocent brother[Beat][A][N]
Forever, he lies forgotten.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I know your pain, Rashid.[A][N]
A past none care to remember[Beat] it's[N]
a tragedy just as painful as watching[N]
its suffering happen the first time.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]As long as at least some[N]
of us who still live on[N]
don't forget the dead[Beat][A][N]
then they still live[N]
on in our hearts.[A][N]
We can still tell their story[N]
to any who will listen. As[N]
long as they're remembered[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I don't know how long[N]
I'll remain here for.[A][N]
I was summoned from nothingness to[N]
fight for the Decian Liberators[Beat][A][N]
who knows when I will return there?[A][N]
In my stead, Reinhilde[Beat] can[N]
you carry on the story of Rodney?[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat][A][N]
I am an old woman.[A][N]
Not as old as you, I[N]
suppose, but still old.[A][N]
The end of my life[N]
draws near as well.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But together, we can tell[N]
many others in the world[N]
of those we have lost.[A][N]
Let me promise this to you, Rashid.[A][N]
No matter what it costs,[N]
even the rest of my life[Beat][N]
I will help you.[A][N]
I will help you make sure[N]
Rodney's story does not fade[N]
into the mists of memory.[A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]thank you, Reinhilde.[N]
Thank you, so, so much.[A][N]
To have even one person who[N]
understands, and is willing[N]
to remember alongside me[Beat][A][N]
You are truly a friend just[N]
as dear as Rodney ever was.[A][X]

[Beat]Reinhilde.
It seems you're well.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You[Beat] I see you have left behind[N]
your hood, Grimblade. You have no[N]
intention of killing me on this day.[AN]
[MidRight]
I suppose you don't need a vision[N]
to see that. Yes, we're on the same[N]
side now, so there's no purpose.[AN]
Are you fine with that, Reinhilde?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My visions have grown stronger[N]
since we arrived in Cythes, you see.[N]
Byelen's power[Beat] I can feel it.[AN]
[MidRight]
What does that have to do with[N]
anything? I asked if you were[N]
alright with us working together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then let me finish. I have seen[Beat][N]
contradictory futures, wreathed[N]
in both light and darkness.[AN]
I dislike you, Grimblade. But your[N]
skill is without question, and we[N]
will have need of it to survive.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, that answer is good enough[N]
for me. I don't want to spend any[N]
more time talking to you, either,[AN]
so let's agree to leave it at that.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Though my visions are incomplete[N]
and uncertain, one thing is clear.[N]
That woman[Beat] her death is nigh.[A][X]

[Beat]Hold a moment, Grimblade.[N]
You're fighting too recklessly.[N]
You should wait for your allies.[AN]
[MidRight]
Allies? What, like you?[N]
You're far too frail for that.[AN]
Besides, I've been fighting all my[N]
life, so I know what I'm doing.[N]
Stand back and let me handle it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Your arrogance will be your undoing.[N]
You think your sword above all others,[N]
but a lone sword is but a slab of steel.[AN]
Yours can break like any other.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What are you implying, Reinhilde?[N]
Do you think I can't handle myself?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I know that you cannot. I have seen[N]
it for myself in one of my clearest[N]
vision, as you fall to the ground.[AN]
You take a sword for the one-eyed[N]
boy, and that will be your end.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Is that so? For Loewe?[N]
Well, there are worse ways to die.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Why? Why are you unperturbed?[AN]
I speak of your death, and you[N]
speak of it as if it is the weather![N]
I am trying to help you, Grimblade![AN]
[MidRight]
Look, I appreciate the thought,[N]
but I'll do what I must to see[N]
our mission through, come what may.[AN]
If that includes my death, so be it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You[Beat] Very well. Then continue to fight[N]
with abandon, if you so wish to speed[N]
up your demise. It is not my concern.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Death, hm? Well,[N]
that's nothing new.[N]
I died long ago[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]Grimblade, wait a moment.[N]
You seem to be fighting with[N]
less caution than even before.[AN]
Our opponent may be a god,[N]
but that is only more reason[N]
for us to move carefully.[AN]
One wrong step could spell our ruin.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What, are you worried about those[N]
visions? Don't worry, Reinhilde.[AN]
Ever since I set off on my quest[N]
and abandoned all that I loved,[N]
I've been a dead woman walking.[AN]
Without my beloved Xerxes,[N]
I have no reason to continue,[N]
save protecting Loewe to the end.[AN]
There's no reason to be concerned,[N]
Reinhilde. Just stay behind me.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You[Beat] Are you mad, Catrin?![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You've let these feelings of misery[N]
fester and fester, and yet, when[N]
we finally near a brighter tomorrow,[AN]
this is how you choose to live?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What does it matter how I live?[N]
You said I would die, remember?[AN]
I may as well go down fighting.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Listen to me well, Catrin. These[N]
visions[Beat] they are not absolute.[AN]
I once saw your death clearly,[N]
but now, it is muddled and uncertain.[AN]
This wretched future sight seems[N]
to be weakening, and so, too,[N]
must be the strings of fate.[AN]
Do you plan to roll over and die,[N]
or will you seize your own destiny?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Even if I wanted to, for what?[AN]
The sword, a hollow pursuit?[A] Loewe,[N]
who I abandoned while we both grieved?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I will not sit here and console you,[N]
Catrin. You have made mistakes, those[N]
that cannot ever be taken back.[AN]
But[Beat] I, too, know the pain of losing[N]
a spouse. My wife died at a young age,[N]
from a plague that wracked our village.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
For many years, I mourned, and for more[N]
afterwards, I convinced myself it was fate,[N]
thanks to these visions. But no longer.[AN]
We cannot allow our tragedies to rule us.[AN]
I cannot tell you what to live for,[N]
Catrin, but there is always a reason.[N]
Even if you must make it for yourself.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Heh. I never thought you, of all[N]
people, would be the one to wake me up.[N]
Your words ring true, Reinhilde.[AN]
I can't let Xerxes's death or my own[N]
failings with my son weigh me down.[AN]
When this is all over[Beat] I'll do all[N]
I can to make things right with Loewe.[N]
And with you, as well, my[Beat] friend.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Hmph. Don't push it, young one.[N]
Still, I look forward to seeing that.[AN]
But for now, we must fight for that[N]
future. I will follow your lead![AN]
[MidRight]
Alright, then[Beat][N]
I'll carve a path forward![A][X]
