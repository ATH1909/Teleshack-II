## Ngondala_Locke_C

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNgondala][OpenMidRight][LoadLocke]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox][Beat] Did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Hm? The paid thief?[N]
No, I'm afraid not.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenQuote]Paid thief" is a degrading title, you know.[N]
I'm more than just that.[AN]
Sure, I do all you'd expect of your[N]
typical thief, but much more.[AN]
I'd expect a noble to understand[N]
me more than most.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I don't know what[N]
you're talking about.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]One thousand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]One thousand what?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]If you give me one thousand[N]
gold, I'll tell you how I can help you.[AN]
In fact, I'll make it a down payment[N]
for whatever services you need.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I really don't know what[N]
you're getting at.[AN]
I've no need for someone with[N]
your set of skills.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Let me know if you change[N]
your mind, then.[A][X]

## Ngondala_Locke_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNgondala][OpenMidRight][LoadLocke]
[OpenMidRight]We meet again.[N]
Did you consider my offer?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It hasn't crossed my mind.[N]
Your sales pitch needs work.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sounds like I need something[N]
a bit more useful to get my way, hm?[AN]
Well, let's see. I'll tell you what.[N]
I'll do something for you.[AN]
Free of charge.[N]
I'm generous, I know.[AN]
You're a noble of Chouwouj.[N]
One of the so-called warlords.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]I'm glad you know that much.[N]
Then you'd probably know I already[N]
have my own intelligence officers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, but they seldom leave your borders.[N]
The situation in Chouwouj won't allow it.[N]
However, that's changed.[AN]
You, Warlord Ngondala, have an opportunity.[N]
A grand opportunity to make it big.[N]
Perhaps even a proper crown.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You really want that gold?[N]
I'm tempted to pay you just so[N]
you stop spewing nonsense.[AN]
My troops in Chouwouj are battered.[N]
Civil strife has engulfed the[N]
country for a long time, now.[AN]
I do not think anyone would[N]
accept me, or any other warlord,[N]
as the monarch without force.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Force? Well, that's one way to do it.[N]
See how that worked out for Taraji?[N]
I have another idea. Diplomacy.[AN]
You know what foreign rulers like[N]
to do to other countries?[N]
Legitimize their governments.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]So you're suggesting you[N]
are like some sort of shady ambassador?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You wound me![N]
I clean up quite well, you know.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm sure.[N]
I appreciate your consideration,[AN]
but really, I am not interested.[N]
Chouwouj needs to be rebuilt.[AN]
That will require collaboration.[N]
Not from the outside, but from within.[AN]
It is through rebuilding that we will[N]
warm the icy relations between warlords,[AN]
and perhaps even know peace for a time.[N]
If I were to use a foreign spy[Beat][AN]
I would be labeled a threat.[N]
I cannot allow that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Alright, alright.[N]
Very well, I'll be off then.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Locke[Beat] if another were to take[N]
his offer, it could spell trouble.[AN]
I hope that I did not drive him[N]
away. Perhaps I can find another use[Beat][A][X]

## Ngondala_Locke_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNgondala][OpenMidRight][LoadLocke]
[OpenMidLeft]Locke.[N]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, Warlord Ngondala.[N]
Come to reconsider my offer?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No, but I have a counter offer.[N]
Would you be kind enough to hear me out?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]I'm listening.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Very good.[N]
You mentioned something that stuck with me[N]
after our previous conversation.[AN]
I've been turning it over in my mind[N]
ever since. It struck a chord with me.[N]
The importance of foreign relations.[AN]
Truth be told, I had not considered this much[N]
until the Decians came and helped us[N]
in our fight against the Pitviper.[AN]
However, while I want the rebuild of[N]
Chouwouj to be by our own hands,[N]
that will require support from others.[AN]
Financial support. Gold. Materials.[N]
We will need help procuring support[N]
and supplies from the other nations.[AN]
You're well-traveled and know who is who[N]
in these places. I'd like you to work[N]
not for me, but for Chouwouj.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Twenty thousand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's[Beat] quite steep.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]There's a lot to consider.[N]
First, think of the travel costs.[N]
Then there's hazard insurance.[AN]
Not to mention the cost of labor,[N]
the price per conversation with a noble[N]
I need to endure[Beat] I think it's a steal.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I get the impression that helping[N]
us all, in the employ of all of Chouwouj,[N]
isn't really to your liking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If I wanted to be a knight,[N]
I'd be a knight. If I wanted to be a noble,[N]
I'd be a noble. I do this because it's freedom.[AN]
I owe nobody anything other than what[N]
they pay me to do.[N]
I have no great love for any nation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Only a great love for coin,[N]
it would appear.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You learn quickly.[N]
I'll tell you what.[AN]
This proposal of yours, I know it well.[N]
You want to keep me busy.[AN]
Ensure I don't do for others what I[N]
offered to do for you, is that it?[AN]
Keep me occupied in some ceremonial[N]
role so you don't have to watch your back.[AN]
Tell me if I need to keep going[N]
or if I've made my point clear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Looks like I was right.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]You're perceptive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And worth every last coin.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
When this battle is over, perhaps[N]
we can work out another arrangement.[AN]
After this fight, who knows what else[N]
will need to be done.[AN]
Do we have a deal?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Going to need to add in a[N]
consultation fee, travel charges, and-[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Locke.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Right, right. Let's discuss later.[A][X]
