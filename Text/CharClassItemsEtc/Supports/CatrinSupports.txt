Ah, Catrin. You seem to be fitting[N]
in well with the Liberators.[AN]
I had worried that after so much time[N]
fighting alone, it may be difficult[N]
to adapt to the feel of an army,[AN]
but clearly, that was foolish of me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I haven't forgotten our time[N]
with Lord Dikembe just yet.[AN]
The military maneuvers and strategies[N]
here aren't that different from then,[N]
either. That's thanks to you, no doubt.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, so you noticed? I thought my[N]
strategems were hidden well enough,[N]
but of course you would understand.[AN]
Perhaps I am simply stuck in my ways,[N]
but those tactics haven't failed me yet.[N]
Not since[Beat] Lord Dikembe was slain.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wish I could've been there, Kwame.[AN]
If I had[Beat] do you think Lord Dikembe[N]
would have survived the conflict?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Who knows? Even after eons of[N]
my life, I am never truly sure[N]
of an outcome before it happens.[AN]
Perhaps your presence would have[N]
been enough, or perhaps you would[N]
have died for nothing, Catrin.[AN]
Neither of us can truly say.[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe so, but I'm just tired of losing[N]
people I care for. Lord Dikembe,[N]
my husband[Beat] and yet, I remain alive.[AN]
How long until it's someone else?[AN]
How long until it's[Beat] Loewe?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I understand that pain of loss,[N]
but when you have lived as long as I,[N]
you accept that death is inevitable.[AN]
The people you love will perish,[N]
one day or another, so all one can do[N]
is delay this with all their effort.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No matter how true that may be,[N]
it's not something I can accept.[AN]
I still remember the look on Xerxes's[N]
face when those Cytheans cut him down[Beat][N]
And his last words for our son.[AN]
To protect Loewe, no matter the cost[Beat][N]
I intend to keep that oath, Kwame.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Do as you wish. I will say no more[N]
on the matter, so let us return to[N]
battle. After you, old friend.[A][X]

Catrin? What is it, friend?[AN]
It is unlike you to approach[N]
me of your own accord.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I've been giving what you said[N]
before some thought, Kwame,[N]
but something's still eating at me.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, if it is within my power[N]
to answer, then please, ask away.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You've lived a long, long time.[N]
Longer than I can even fathom.[AN]
So, surely, you've lost more[N]
people that you care about[N]
than anyone, over and over.[AN]
How do you accept that loss,[N]
and move on despite the pain?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hm. Let me provide an example,[N]
and perhaps that will illustrate[N]
the point I am trying to make.[AN]
In my[Beat] youth, I was well acquainted[N]
with an emperor of Cythes and served[N]
a similar role as I did with our lord.[AN]
He was an ambitious man, one who[N]
saw all of Orodreth as his right,[N]
and acted accordingly, come what may.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Where are you going with this?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You will see, soon enough. Regardless,[N]
he trusted me with his very life.[N]
I thought we had an understanding[Beat][AN]
But with time, other words reached[N]
his ears from those with ignoble[N]
aspirations, spurring delusion.[AN]
I had hoped that he would see things[N]
my way[Beat] but after he didn't,[N]
I had no choice but to take action.[AN]
To do what I should have, long ago.[AN]
I felt that keen sense of loss[N]
from betraying one I saw as a son[Beat][AN]
But everything that I have done,[N]
I have done for the greater good,[N]
no matter what cost that may entail.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So you're saying that keeping my[N]
focus on a single goal helps dull[N]
that pain? I understand the point,[AN]
but my goal here is to protect[N]
my son, not to accept his death.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then accept the losses that will entail.[N]
Devote your entire being to that goal,[N]
and you can accept any result.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I see. I'll have to think on it,[N]
Kwame. Tell me something, though.[AN]
Can you[Beat] Can you protect him,[N]
until Byelen is gone once and for all?[AN]
You're the only person I can ask.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Of course, Catrin.[N]
I won't let him die,[N]
you have my word.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Thank you. That takes a load off my[N]
mind, Kwame. Now, let's finish this![A][X]
