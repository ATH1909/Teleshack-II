Hey! Long time no see, Buldak.[AN]
It feels like a long, long time since[N]
you left to join the Freyse rebels.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]So you joined the Liberators, Tao.[N]
How are you holding up these days?[N]
I[Beat] I'm sorry, about Mifan.[AN]
I never should've sided with Korovai.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, what's done is done. I know that[N]
you were manipulated by them too,[N]
so the blame's not all on you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Manipulated, huh? Maybe so,[N]
but it was still all my fault.[AN]
Even if they told me that no harm[N]
would come to our village, I should[N]
have known that was a bald-faced lie.[AN]
Why else would the Freysian rebels[N]
be so curious about nearby villages,[N]
flush with food stores to pilfer?[AN]
[Beat]No, they intended to use force[N]
the moment Mifan rejected the request.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I see. Then the Liberators, and even[N]
Korovai himself, couldn't have done a[N]
thing without your info. Is that right?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah. If you want to blame anyone,[N]
then blame me. I deserve that much.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Anyway, that's all I have to say there.[AN]
I swore to Commander Cleo that I'd[N]
atone for all the harm I've done,[N]
so that's why I'm still around.[AN]
Speaking of[Beat] We'd better not stay[N]
here long with a battle going on.[N]
Stay safe, Tao.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Blame you, huh[Beat] Yeah, I think[N]
I'll take you up on that, Buldak.[AN]
If not for you, Mi would still[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]I can hear it. A bowstring's being[N]
drawn back, right in front of me[Beat][N]
Is the day of my death finally here?[AN]
Well, I can't complain after all I've[N]
done[Beat][CloseEyes] Please, just make it quick.[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadTao][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, what are you waiting[N]
for? Take the shot already.[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
[Beat][A]
[MoveMidLeft][MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The heck's with that[Beat] I guess[N]
those ears of yours are why[N]
you got hired on as a tracker.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tao? Ah, I see[Beat] You haven't really[N]
forgiven anyone. I thought that story[N]
was too convenient, and I was right.[AN]
It's not so easy to forgive and forget.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, it isn't. You told me to blame[N]
you, and with Korovai and his cronies[N]
gone, there's no one else who can be.[AN]
If I don't kill you[Beat] Then Mi[N]
will lie unavenged, forever.[AN]
I can't allow that to happen.[AN]
[MidRight]
If that's the case, then hurry it up.[AN]
One of our allies might come if you[N]
wait too long, wasting your chance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why are you so[Beat] Never mind that.[AN]
Tell me, Buldak. What was so worth[N]
it that made you willing to risk[N]
the safety of our friends and family,[AN]
dragging them to an early grave?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Gold, glory, and all that would[N]
give us. Korovai's army paid me well[N]
to track whatever they wanted to find.[AN]
I thought that with the money they gave,[N]
I could buy all that rice back and make[N]
a name for myself throughout Freyse.[AN]
Then, I'd be in a position to make even[N]
more money after Cythes left our borders.[AN]
Enough so that we'd never have to worry[N]
about food again[Beat] And that Mi's[N]
burden would be just a bit lighter.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]So you didn't want those things for[N]
the sake of it? You had an actual goal?[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, but what does it matter now?[AN]
Because of me, Mi and everyone else[N]
is dead. No matter how much I atone,[N]
that's never going to go away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You're right, Buldak. Redemption[N]
is a lost cause for you, but you[N]
shouldn't atone just because of that.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You're[Beat] lowering your bow?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I just realized that killing you[N]
wouldn't do any good, either.[AN]
That's the easy way out for you.[N]
Instead, I want you to promise[N]
me something, in Mi's memory.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, then say it.[N]
I'll do whatever I can.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You and me, we'll rebuild the village[N]
to be even better than it was before.[AN]
There are still people left in Shagahn,[N]
mostly folks who didn't want to fight[N]
and fled when Korovai's army came.[AN]
If we can get some of 'em to settle[N]
back in, and put in the work to restore[N]
the village, I'm sure Mi would be happy.[A]
[MidRight]
That's a tall task, given the state[N]
that Korovai and the Liberators[N]
left it in[Beat] but alright, I promise.[AN]
The ruins of Shagahn[Beat] We'll bring[N]
them back to their former glory![A][X]
