Hey, I remember you.[AN]
You're that dancer who[N]
lives back in town, yeah?[AN]
Jacinth, was it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yep, that's me.[AN]
Is there anything[N]
you need, miss?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've heard you make[N]
delectable drinks.[AN]
I just wanted to ask[N]
if I can try one.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, sure thing![AN]
Obviously not right[N]
now, but I can prep[N]
something back at camp.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Thanks a bunch, Jacinth![AN]
Oh, and the name's Darby.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
It was nice meeting you, Darby.[AN]

Same to you, Jacinth.[AN][X]

So, how was the[N]
drink, Darby?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've never had anything[N]
better![AN]
And I thought the local tavern[N]
was the ceam of the crop![AN]
Made a great pair with my[N]
special steak, too.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your specialty steak?[AN]
I knew you hunted and[N]
all,[AN]
but I didn't know you[N]
had your own recipes.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I have my own[N]
special seasoning.[AN]
I'll make one for[N]
you sometime.[AN]
Only fair to repay you[N]
for that delicious drink.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I can't wait![AN][X]

My, that steak was[N]
delicious, Darby.[AN]
[MidRight]
It was my pleasure,[N]
Jacinth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Chouwoujian drinks and[N]
Decian steak[AN]
make a truly magnificent[N]
combo.[AN]
I've had a lot of fun[N]
together, Darby.[AN]
[MidRight]
As have I, Jacinth.[AN]
You can count on me any[N]
time,[AN]
whether it be on the[N]
battlefield or a campfire.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And I've got your back[N]
too, Darby.[AN][X]
