Hey, I remember you.[AN]
You're that dancer who[N]
lives back in town, yeah?[AN]
Jacinth, was it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yep, that's me.[AN]
Is there anything[N]
you need, miss?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've heard you make[N]
delectable drinks.[AN]
I just wanted to ask[N]
if I can try one.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, sure thing![AN]
Obviously not right[N]
now, but I can prep[N]
something back at camp.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Thanks a bunch, Jacinth![AN]
Oh, and the name's Darby.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
It was nice meeting you, Darby.[AN]
[MidRight]
Same to you, Jacinth.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
So, how was the[N]
drink, Darby?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've never had anything[N]
better![AN]
And I thought the local tavern[N]
was the ceam of the crop![AN]
Made a great pair with my[N]
special steak, too.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your specialty steak?[AN]
I knew you hunted and[N]
all,[AN]
but I didn't know you[N]
had your own recipes.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I have my own[N]
special seasoning.[AN]
I'll make one for[N]
you sometime.[AN]
Only fair to repay you[N]
for that delicious drink.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I can't wait![AN][X]

[MidLeft]
My, that steak was[N]
delicious, Darby.[AN]
[MidRight]
It was my pleasure,[N]
Jacinth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Chouwoujian drinks and[N]
Decian steak[AN]
make a truly magnificent[N]
combo.[AN]
I've had a lot of fun[N]
together, Darby.[AN]
[MidRight]
As have I, Jacinth.[AN]
You can count on me any[N]
time,[AN]
whether it be on the[N]
battlefield or a campfire.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And I've got your back[N]
too, Darby.[AN][X]

## ApsisJacinthC
[MidLeft][LoadApsis][MidRight][LoadJacinth]
[MidRight]
Those tomes[Beat][AN]
They're nothing like[N]
I've ever seen before.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Pah, what do you want[N]
now, Jacinth?[AN]
Unless you're gonna dance,[N]
please stand back.[AN]
My magic is far too bizarre[N]
for most to understand.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Huh, he's pretty standoffish.[AN]
And here I was, just about to[N]
tell him about a magical artifact.[AN][X]

## ApsisJacinthB
[MidLeft][LoadApsis][MidRight][LoadJacinth]
[MidLeft]
What do you want now,[N]
Jacinth?[AN]
I told you to stay away[N]
from me.[AN]
[MidRight]
I could listen to your[N]
request[Beat][AN]
Or I could tell you of[N]
Cherne's Inkwell?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Cherne's Inkwell?[AN]
Do your drinks mess[N]
with your head?[AN]
The inkwell's naught but[N]
a fairy tale for children.[AN]
[MidRight]
In a world as rich as[N]
this,[AN]
you would deny a way[N]
to craft new spells?[AN]
They'd make your current[N]
works seem weak.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So, you find my magic[N]
insufficient.[AN]
[MidRight]
Not at all.[AN]
But the inkwell is[N]
true, Apsis.[AN]
How else did my dance[N]
get its enchanting properties?[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you claim to be a[N]
beneficiary of the inkwell?[AN]
[MidRight]
Precisely, Apsis.[AN]
And I'll tell you more[N]
when it's less noisy.[AN]
The details are best[N]
left to private ears.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then I shall entertain[N]
your request, Jacinth.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
It's my pleasure, Apsis.[AN][X]

## ApsisJacinthA
[MidLeft][LoadApsis][MidRight][LoadJacinth]
[MidLeft]
I don't have time[N]
to dilly-dally, Jacinth.[AN]
Let's just get this[N]
over with.[AN]
[MidRight]
Very well then.[AN]
As you know, Cherne's[N]
Inkwell is an artifact[AN]
that allows one to craft[N]
powerful spells.[AN]
Not to the level of divine[N]
power,[AN]
but enough to be relevant[N]
to a battlefield.[AN]
But the inkwell belongs[N]
to no treasure chest.[AN]
It belongs to a mysterious[N]
man only known as Veid.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I know of this Veid.[AN]
He offers great power,[N]
but at a great cost.[AN]
[MidRight]
And he procures that power[N]
with the inkwell.[AN]
He provided my dance with[N]
its reinvigorating effect.[AN]
But[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
The price of that[N]
enchantment?[AN]
[MidRight]
I'd rather not say.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So, that power is[N]
supposedly true.[AN]
But how can I trust you?[AN]
You're an entertainer,[AN]
for all I know, this is[N]
just a tale taller than Barod.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then I'll have you meet[N]
Veid after we're done.[AN]
I'm something of an associate[N]
to him.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph.[AN]
I shall trust you[N]
this once, Jacinth.[AN]
[MidRight]
I won't let you down, Apsis.[AN][X]
