Hmm[Beat] Looks like the area is clear.[AN]
Iskra, the way ahead is safe,[N]
so you can stop hiding now.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadIskra][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm not scared, alright?[AN]
It's just good to be safe.[N]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Heh, there's no need to act brave.[AN]
I'd do the same if I were you.[N][ToggleSmile]
We've lost too many fine people[N]
to approach our enemies recklessly.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Mm[Beat] Like General Dragana.[AN]
I keep thinking, what if one of us[N]
had warned her before the attack?[AN]
Could we have saved her?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I've wondered the same,[N]
Iskra. If only I was faster,[N]
if only I took the hit instead[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Mom![A] Don't talk like that. I mean,[N]
the general's death was a big blow,[N]
but if I lost you instead, I[Beat][AN]
I don't know what I would do.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I understand your feelings, I do,[N]
but even so, I would've done it.[AN]
It was my duty[Beat] and I failed.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Hey, Mom. Do you remember that time[N]
when you had General Dragana watch me[N]
and Loewe while you were on a mission?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] no, I don't remember it well.[AN]
Why do you ask, Iskra?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I never really understood all you did,[N]
but I knew it was really dangerous.[AN]
You were gone all the time, too.[N]
So I asked her a question back then.[N]
[Beat] "Will my mom come back?"[AN]
Do you know what she said to me?[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
She said that she would never send[N]
you on a job that you couldn't finish.[AN]
That she would never leave a[N]
daughter without her mother.[AN]
[Beat]She wouldn't have wanted[N]
you to take that blow, Mom.[N]
So[Beat] don't blame yourself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][OpenEyes]You're right, of course.[N]
Still, I needed to hear that.[AN]
No matter what-ifs we ask,[N]
it doesn't change what happened.[N]
We can only move forward.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveFarFarRight]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Wait[Beat] you meant that literally?[AN]
Hold on, don't leave me behind![AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadMira][TwoLineBox]
Iskra? We need to keep moving,[N]
so why are you stopped here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Huh? Oh, sorry.[AN]
It's just[Beat] I've been[N]
thinking about something.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What is it?[N]
You can tell me anything.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I overheard you and Cidor talking.[AN]
You said that if I ever wanted to know[N]
who my father was, I could ask.[AN]
So is he[Beat] is that man my father?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]He is.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]How did you even fall for him, Mom?[AN]
A man cruel enough to kill the general[N]
couldn't possibly be a good person![AN]
[MidRight]
He did that because he believed[N]
appeasing Cythes was all he could do[N]
to maintain what freedom Decia had.[AN]
Cidor was always most concerned with his[N]
subjects. If an empire came knocking at[N]
your door, what would you do, Iskra?[AN]
With an entire barony of people to[N]
protect, would you fight back,[N]
knowing it could mean their deaths?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Of course I would! Cythes took so[N]
much from us[Beat] You're saying it[N]
was right for Cidor to bend the knee?[AN]
Like a coward?! Like a traitor?![AN]
[MidRight]
No![A] That's why I left, Iskra.[AN]
I couldn't agree with his decision.[N]
But before Cythes forced his[N]
hand, Cidor was a good man.[AN]
He was so warm and gentle[Beat][N]
He treated no one, no matter their[N]
station, as if they were unworthy.[AN]
[Beat]And he loved you more than anything.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But that love wasn't enough to sway him[N]
from his duty. I warned him, you know.[AN]
I told him that if he let Cythes pass[N]
uninhibited, I would leave and take[N]
you with me[Beat] He didn't try to stop me,[AN]
and he didn't try to persuade me that[N]
vassalhood was all Decia could achieve.[AN]
He merely asked if he could hold you,[N]
one last time before I took you away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you[Beat] Do you think he could have[N]
changed his mind, if he knew where[N]
we would be now? That we would win?[N]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I can never know, Iskra. None of us[N]
can predict where our paths will lead.[AN]
All we can do is make our choices[N]
and hope we won't regret them.[N]
I made mine.[A] He made his.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] You're right.[N]
Besides, we're not done yet![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, we're not. And even when we are,[N]
Decia will still have need of us.[AN]
That includes you now, Iskra.[AN]
Your magical skill has surpassed that[N]
of your father's[Beat] It could prove[N]
very useful in rebuilding Decia.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]And it will, Mom. At first, I only[N]
joined the Liberators to protect you[N]
and Loewe[Beat] but now, it's different.[AN]
I'll keep fighting[Beat] I'll make sure[N]
that my father's death was not in vain![AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Mira[Beat] I'm glad you survived[N]
those dreadful catacombs.[AN]
So many died that I feared the[N]
worst when I couldn't find you.[AN]
[MidRight]
I can't exactly leave you and[N]
Boro as the only founders left.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Neither of you have the brains[N]
or means to do the dirty work[N]
that I've done all these years.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! Well, you're not wrong there.[N]
The both of us are too obtuse for[N]
spywork, vital though it may be.[AN]
Without you, I doubt the Liberators[N]
would have made it this far.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
True, but our journey's end nears.[N]
Cythes stands defeated, and all that[N]
remains in our way is Kwame.[AN]
Now I know why he didn't react at[N]
all when I threatened him before[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
You what? [Beat]Never mind, it doesn't[N]
matter now. You're right. This[N]
will be our last battle, friend.[AN]
[MidRight]
As Liberators maybe, but the job's[N]
not done back at home. Remnants of[N]
Decian turncoats still remain,[AN]
and the people live in uncertainty.[AN]
We have a long way to go to realize[N]
the world Dragana wished for.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mhm[Beat] I've been thinking about what[N]
we can do to ease that transition.[AN]
The people need a strong but wise[N]
leader, and peers to hold that leader[N]
accountable. Who could fit that bill?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, you're the most senior member[N]
of the Liberators remaining,[N]
and the citizens already trust you.[AN]
Most of them directed their complaints[N]
and pleas to you after Cidor's defeat,[N]
since our group was off in Mahemen.[AN]
Why not take the job yourself?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] No, it shouldn't be my choice.[N]
The people should have say in who,[N]
if anyone, holds power over them.[AN]
And as much as I'd like to, taking[N]
on all the work myself isn't feasible.[AN]
Perhaps we can form a council of peers,[N]
each covering an interest of governing,[N]
that are selected by the chosen leader.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Sounds good to me. You know my skills,[N]
so if you need someone to handle[N]
intelligence gathering, let me know.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Absolutely. If I'm chosen to lead,[N]
then you'll be the first person I ask.[AN]
[MidRight]
Good... Dragana left Decia up to us,[N]
so we have to keep fighting, Trajan.[N]
No matter what that opponent may be.[N]
[MidLeft]
Right, but first, let's deal with the[N]
one before us. We've already beaten[N]
one god.[A] What's one more?[AN][X]

[MidRight]
You're still alive, Boro?[N]
I can't say if I'm glad or sad.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Glad, I hope, since I just speared[N]
a swordsman that would've killed you.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
And I just stabbed a man so that his[N]
axe fell to the ground, not on you.[AN]
Consider us even on that front.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
Ha! You haven't lost a step, Mira.[N]
Not in your swordplay or sharp tongue.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, because I didn't quit on us.[AN]
A wayward mind leads to a dull blade,[N]
and no one's more non-committal than you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Say whatever you like, Mira.[AN]
After we're done defeating Cherne,[N]
you'll never have to see me again.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then you're just going to run away,[N]
again? So you're a coward, not a fool.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Run away? Clearly, I'm not needed[N]
or wanted here. I can't blame you,[N]
after Dragana, but it is what it is.[AN]
You and Trajan can handle Decia's[N]
management without me, I'm sure.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, we can't! Look, Trajan's a good[N]
leader, and I can gather intelligence,[AN]
but neither of us have the same mind[N]
for real combat that you did back then.[AN]
Dragana relied on your combat prowess[N]
to carve a path. Without it, so many[N]
of our strategies would've failed,[AN]
but your presence alone swung battles.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat].I've already failed you once.[N]
Are you sure you want to take[N]
another chance on a betrayer?[AN]
[MidRight]
Want? No, we NEED to take a chance.[AN]
I can't let my personal grudges stand[N]
in the way of what's best for Decia.[AN]
Besides[Beat]. Dragana would have wanted[N]
it this way, Boro. You know that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat]. Yeah, I do. She was a bleeding[N]
heart to the end[Beat]. Alright, Mira.[AN]
I'll support Decia, but in my own way.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Fine by me, but you can't just operate[N]
however you please. Run things by me[N]
if you plan on doing anything reckless.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat].Alright, we'll work together.[N]
Just like old times, huh Mira?[AN]
Wait[Beat]. What's wrong with your face?[N]
Usually, your mouth is more[Beat]. downward.[AN]
[MidRight]
...Boro, are you-[.4][N]
[Beat]Ugh, forget it.[AN][X]
