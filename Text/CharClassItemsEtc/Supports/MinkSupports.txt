Hello there! You must be The Augur,[N]
famed bringer of omens.[AN]
[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove](Hmph, another one.)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
It is as you say, I am she who[N]
peers beyond the veil of fate.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Excellent, my name is Mink,[N]
I have a request for you.[AN]
[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove](Bah, here we go again...)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
With you, I see the warmth of[N]
the sun and chill of a glacier.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh?[AN]
[MidRight]
The wisdom you carry will[N]
be passed along thr-[AN]
[MidLeft][MidBlink]
You know, for someone who can[N]
see into the future,[AN]
you sure are bad at predicting[N]
what I was actually going to ask.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I wasn't going to ask for you[N]
to tell my fortune,[AN]
I was actually more interested[N]
in learning more about you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wait, really?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you'd be willing to indulge[N]
me of course.[AN]
[MidRight]
Why[Beat] of course![AN]
[MidLeft]
Excellent![AN]
The battle seems to be picking up,[N]
so let us reconvein soon.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, I look forward to[N] 
our next meeting![AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Oh, what a splend oppertunity this[N]
will be to learn more[AN]
of Mahemen history directly from[N]
such a renown figure![A][X]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]so what are your thoughts[N]
on the Kekepania Revolt?[AN]
[MidRight]
Bah, that was a terrible day.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
Yes?[AN]
[MidRight]
Our family meal that we had[N]
been looking foward to[AN]
was completely ruined[N]
by sheer incompetence![AN]
[Left][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] see.[AN]
[MidRight]
We had been saving for months[N]
to import a Chouwoujian Boar,[AN]
you should've seen it,[N] 
it was beautiful![AN]
And what does cousin Burkhard,[AN]
curse his name,[A] do?[AN]
He drowns the poor[N]
thing in salt![AN]
Absolutely ruins it!!![AN]
[MidLeft]
Mhm-hm.[AN]
[MidRight]
I tell you, I told them all[AN]
[OpenQuote]keep that cretin Burkhard[N]
away lest he ruins the meal."[AN]
And somehow, they still let him[N]
come to other gatherings![AN]
Bah, no one listens to me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well then[Beat][AN]
How about the Kalei movement?[AN]
What was life like before[N]
and after it?[AN]
[MidRight]
That was when my brother[N]
got married![AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] imagine that was[N]
a happy time for you all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, she was the sweetest thing,[N]
and a great weaver at that![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
She made the most wonderful[N]
clothing![A] It looked great[N]
and helped keep us cool![AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat][AN]
What about the earthquake that[N]
decimated the city of Nani?[AN]
You were instrumental in[N]
preventing the deaths[N]
of thousands, were you not?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
Oh yes![A] During that time[N]
I remember meeting a cute[N]
child who drew the most ador-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Look. These stories are[N]
neat and all,[A] but[N]
could you please focus on[N]
the events I'm asking about?[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight][OneLineBox]
Hold your tongue![AN]
[MidLeft]
What?[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
It's always the same thing![AN]
You aren't interested to learn[N]
a damn thing about me at all![AN]
I was only just some way for you[N]
to get what you wanted,[AN]
just like everyone else![AN]
No, with you it was worse;[AN]
you had the audacity to make me[N]
believe for once that someone cared.[AN]
To feel that false hope.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
Stay away from me,[A] never[N] 
speak to me again.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]what have I done?[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAugur]
[MidRight]
Finally! A window of time[N]
to speak to you again[AN]
[MidLeft]
Still you choose to close your[N]
ears to my words.[AN]
Never again did I wish[N]
to speak with you.[AN]
[MidRight]
You might have the power[N]
to glimpse the future,[AN]
but I know you don't know[N]
what I have to say to you.[AN]
You wouldn't continue to[N]
avoid me if you did![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I need not future sight[N]
to see you for the cold[N]
serpent you are![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Look[Beat] please hear me out,[N]
just this one last time ok?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left]
Please![AN]
[MidRight]
Get on with it and speak the[N]
empty words you've brewed.[AN]
[Left][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You were right, I didn't seek[N]
you out for your sake;[AN]
I really did only care about[N]
the history of Mahemen itself.[AN]
I also didn't realize the burden[N]
that you've had to live with.[AN]
For all my learnedness, I never[N]
bothered to learn about the actual[N]
person who had to endure this firsthand.[AN]
Worse still, any small signs I did[N]
find of your turmoil, I brushed off.[AN]
So[Beat][AN]
I'm through with it.[AN]
I'm done talking to you just[N]
to learn the history of Mahamen.[AN]
Never again will I use you[N]
as a means to an end.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
I appreciate your honesty.[AN]
[MidLeft]
With all that said, I would[N]
like to start over[AN]
and truly become[N]
your friend.[AN]
[MidRight]
Bah, all that apologizing, only[N]
to try your scheme again?[AN]
[MidLeft]
As much of a burden your[N]
future sight has been,[AN]
surely it can reveal the[N]
truth of my intentions.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]the warmth of the sun[N]
and[Beat][A] a thawing glacier[Beat][AN]
[Beat][Beat]I'll give you a chance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you.[AN]
Then, let us start at the begining.[AN]
I want to know what your name is.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]you know me to be the Augur.[A]
[MidLeft]
No, I mean your actual name.[AN]
I certainly hope that "The" isn't[N]
your first name after all.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry, I hope I wasn't[N]
out of line again.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]it's been so long since[N]
someone actually asked that.[AN]
[Beat]Reinhilde[Beat] my name is Reinhilde[AN]
[MidLeft]
Reinhilde[Beat] what a lovely name.[AN]
[MidRight]
I have something to show you.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveLeft]
[Left][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft]
A drawing?[N]
Ah! What an adorable dog![AN]
[MidRight]
His name was Bruno, he was[N]
once my faithful companion.[AN]
[MidLeft]
He sounds like a very cool dog.[AN]
Tell me all about him.[A][X]
