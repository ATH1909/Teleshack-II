Ahahahaha! The scent of battle[N]
is strong today, my friends![N]
Fight until you drop![AN]
[MidRight][LoadLyre]
Jerry, get a hold of yourself![N]
This isn't a bar fight,[N]
there are real weapons here.[AN]
We need to approach this carefully[N]
if we want to survive this battle.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Bah. Always out to ruin my fun,[N]
aren't you? Next you'll *hic* tell[N]
me that I'm drinking too much.[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe if you weren't stumbling[N]
around like you have two left legs,[N]
I wouldn't need to say anything.[AN]
Honestly, Jerry[Beat][N]
How have you survived this long?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh[Beat] I wonder the same thing.[AN]
I keep going from battle to battle,[N]
waiting for my last *hic* blood rush,[N]
but no one's managed to kill me yet.[AN]
These fights with the Liberators[N]
are heating up, though[Beat] Taraji[N]
never had us in ones this tough.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's because the commanders trust us![N]
Taraji took on so much of our battles[N]
that we were basically just guardsmen.[AN]
This must be more suitable for you,[N]
though. It's been a long time since[N]
you've had to fight for real, right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Aye. Haven't raised this axe with[N]
purpose for a long *hic* while[Beat][AN]
Well, we've spent plenty o' time[N]
here talking it up, but there's[N]
work to be done. See you around, Lyre.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What a sorry sight you are.[AN]
I can hardly recognize the man[N]
who taught me how to use an axe[Beat][N]
Have you really forgotten, Jerry?[A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, look who it is. Look, I've[N]
been *hic* responsible today.[AN]
I won't cause any trouble for[N]
your precious commanders,[N]
so just leave me be, Lyre.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's not why I'm here, Jerry.[N]
I had something else in mind.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh? Well, make it snappy.[N]
We've got fightin' to do.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What does the name [OpenQuote]Lyrato" mean[N]
to you? Ring any bells, drunkard?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]How do you know[N]
*hic* that name?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
So you have heard of her. That's good.[AN]
I suspected all that booze had[N]
dulled your memories altogether,[N]
but it seems there's a fragment left.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That girl[Beat] King Moti's bastard?[N]
What's she matter to you, Lyr-[N]
No, that's[Beat] You can't be![AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, but I am. It's been a long time,[N]
[OpenQuote]Jerry." I must admit, using that[N]
name feels rather awkward for me.[AN]
Do you mind if I call you[Beat] Jeremiah?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Then you really are Lyrato?[N]
I[Beat] How are you still alive?[N]
I thought that you were-[AN]
[MidRight]
Dead? Yes, Lord Dikembe wanted people[N]
to think that. He sheltered me, but[N]
I could only stay hidden for so long.[AN]
When he died, I went my own way,[N]
looking for the warrior who had[N]
watched over me for so long.[AN]
Sir Jeremiah, the finest of King Moti's[N]
men[Beat] What a pathetic sight you were,[N]
drowning your sorrows in cheap booze.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Judge me if you want, but I'm not[N]
that man anymore. If you seek my aid,[N]
you won't find it, Lady Lyrato.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm not asking you, Jeremiah.[N]
This[Beat] is a demand.[A] An order.[AN]
Do you see this pendant?[AN]
The one you swore an oath to?[N]
It is proof of my lineage as[N]
an heir of the Chouwouj line.[AN]
Clean yourself up, Jeremiah,[N]
and follow the oath that you[N]
failed to uphold with my father.[AN]
This is your chance at redemption.[N]
Help me overthrow the warlords and[N]
restore the place of the royal line.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Even if I wanted to, what use[N]
is there for me now? My skills[N]
aren't what they used to be.[AN]
I'm[Beat] just a man waiting to die.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Hmph. If that is truly what[N]
you want, then do what you will.[AN]
But if even a part of you wants to see[N]
a reunified Chouwouj, and vengeance[N]
for my father[Beat] then stand up.[AN]
Put down the pint, and regain the[N]
form that so many feared you for.[AN]
I know you still have that power,[N]
Jerry. You only need to grasp it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Heh, you're just like him.[N]
King Moti would be proud,[N]
seeing how you've grown up.[AN]
Fine, I'll do it, but you're[N]
gonna have to help me, milady.[N]
I can't give up the liquor on my own.[AN]
[MidRight]
Consider it done, Jeremiah.[AN]
After we're done helping Cleo and[N]
Loewe, we'll return to Chouwouj[N]
at once and begin our preparations.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As you wish, Lady Lyrato![AN]
I'll crush every last enemy[N]
who'd dare stand against you![AN][X]
