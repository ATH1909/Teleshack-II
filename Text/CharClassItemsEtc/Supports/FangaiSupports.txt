[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight]Fangai, what are you making?[N]
I can smell it from miles away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Tippany![N]
Just who I wanted to see.[AN]
I'm making a type of bone broth[N]
with some leftover chicken bones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Isn't that just a soup?[N]
I've never heard of this broth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All bone broths are soups,[N]
but not all soups are bone broths![AN]
You see the difference?[N]
I've heard bone broth is more nutritious,[AN]
a good way to stay in top shape![A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that something you learned[N]
from your time as a student of Cherne?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My time as a student was[N]
something I prefer to forget,[AN]
but I cannot deny the skills I learned[N]
helped me a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I'm sorry.[N]
I know it may not've been[Beat] pleasant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, we can let the past[N]
be the past, Tippany.[AN]
Come, the soup is almost ready.[N]
Will you have some?[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] I have some questions[N]
about the seasoning,[AN]
but maybe I can try after the battle.[A][X]

## Fangai_Tippany_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]Fangai, what's wrong?[N]
I had trouble finding you today.[N]
There was no scent of cooked food.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, Tippany, it was awful![N]
You remember the bone broth I made?[N]
The one you said was delicious?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did I say that?[N]
I mean, yes, it was good.[N]
One of the better bone broths I've tried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I was feeling confident[N]
after you shared this with me, and[N]
so I made another batch later on.[AN]
However, I made this soup for a[N]
special someone. Tippany, she may[N]
have even been [OpenQuote]the one"![A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]How do you mean, Fangai?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]She was the perfect woman.[N]
Tall, smart, interested in food,[N]
held good opinions, modestly wealthy[Beat][AN]
I could not ask for a better suitor![N]
But alas, it was all for naught.[N]
A total waste1[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]What happened?[N]
The soup didn't kill her, did it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]No! She said it was bland[N]
and uninteresting! She even insinuated[N]
that I, too, was the same![A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]How did you insinuate that?[N]
I'm sure she likes you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]She said [OpenQuote]this broth of yours[N]
is bland and uninteresting, like you.[N]
It's over". Oh, I was destroyed![AN]
After you told me how much you liked[N]
the soup, I knew she would enjoy it.[N]
But alas, I misjudged! Stupid, stupid, stupid![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fangai, I'm sorry[Beat][N]
I know how much it can sting[N]
to be rejected[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Sniff[Beat] Excuse me, Tippany,[N]
but I need to be alone, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] I really should've told him it[N]
could've used more salt.[AN]
I need to make it up to him somehow.[N]
He was so sad[Beat][A][X]

## Fangai_Tippany_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Fangai, how are you feeling?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Terrible, awful, distraught,[N]
but most of all, incredibly lonely, Tippany.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the soup hating woman?[N]
I'm sorry, Fangai.[AN]
I really am sorry.[N]
This is my fault.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You did nothing wrong, Tippany.[N]
This is entirely on me.[AN]
I'm the one who is unworthy of[N]
being loved[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it is my fault.[N]
I lied to you.[AN]
I said the soup was delicious,[N]
but it was lacking in salt.[AN]
It could've been seasoned more.[N]
I shouldn't have lied.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tippany[Beat] you're my friend.[N]
Why did you lie to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I ask myself the same question.[N]
I suppose[Beat][AN]
I didn't want you to feel bad if[N]
I disliked something you made.[AN]
And it's not even like I disliked it![N]
It just needed some tweaks.[AN]
But[Beat] I am reminded of when I began[N]
to study the ways of Cherne.[AN]
Being a student gave me a sense of[N]
camraderie I'd never had before.[AN]
I was so desperate for friends,[N]
for any sort of human connection[Beat][AN]
I was willing to hold back how I felt[N]
to please others. Even now[Beat][AN]
I still struggle to be truthful.[N]
Fangai, I hope you understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I understand completely.[N]
Those who follow Cherne do so because[N]
they are lost and in need of a shepherd.[AN]
It is in our very nature to crave[N]
the companionship of others[Beat][N]
I forgive you, Tippany.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never did ask you how you[N]
found yourself a student of Cherne.[N]
But I think I understand, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[Beat] I'm just glad we are[N]
both out. Our own people now.[N]
But scars take time to heal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes[Beat] too long, in fact.[N]
But we will get better.[N]
I'm sorry about what happened. Really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Worry not, just tell me if it[N]
needs more salt next time, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That I can do.[N]
Thanks, Fangai.[A][X]
