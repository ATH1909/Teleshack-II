Heyo, you the guy who[N]
did the cookin' for us?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Why yes I am. Chef Fangai,[N]
at your service![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
'names Faolan, doin' my part[N]
for the liberation movement.[AN]
Just wanted to thank you for[N]
the fish we ate on the trip[N]
from the hideout.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ooh, I'm so happy to hear that![AN]
I appreciate a connoisseur[N]
of the culinary arts.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah![A] It's just-[AN]
It's been a while since I got[N]
the chance to have fish.[AN]
What with the vicegrip the[N]
empire had on us.[AN]
And, I gotta say,[AN]
I ain't ever had fish like[N]
that before.[AN]
Gotta admit,[AN]
it looked and smelled a bit[N]
strange,[A] what with all the[N]
stuff you put on.[AN]
But, truth be told, once I tried[N]
it, it was some amazin' stuff.[AN]
Heck, I'd even say that was[N]
the best fish I'd ever had![AN]
[Beat]'course, don't let it[N]
slip that I said that![AN]
My ma would give me such a[N]
walloping if she heard![AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, thank you for the kind words![AN]
It wasn't my finest[N]
work by any means,[AN]
but I'm glad it ended up[N]
enjoyable in the end.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wha-[AN]
Ain't even one of your best?![AN]
Mr. Fangai, you're amazing![AN]
How'd you learn to[N]
cook so good?[AN]
[MidRight]
I picked these skills up[N]
traveling the world,[AN]
[MidLeft]
Travelin' all over the world huh?[AN]
[MidRight]
I'd also experiment and mix and match[N]
different ingredients and techniques.[AN]
Plenty of times, the result would[N]
be less than edible,[AN]
but sometimes, as was with the fish,[N]
it ends up being a rousing success![AN]
[MidLeft]
Damn[Beat][AN]
Never would've thought you could[N]
learn all that just from travelin'.[AN]
[MidRight]
The world is a magnificent oyster,[AN]
her bounties ripe for the taking,[N]
and all you've got to do is look![AN]
[MidLeft]
Wow[Beat][AN][X]

## FaolanFangai_B

[MidLeft][LoadFaolan]
Mr. Fangai, you did it again![AN]
That stuff you made on the[N]
way to Mahemen was excellent![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
A thousand joys to see[N]
you again, Faolan![AN]
I wanted to make sure[N]
I made something[AN]
that complemented[N]
the climate.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It sure as heck did![N]
You blew my mind once again,[AN]
never knew you could make[N]
somethin' outta fruit like that.[AN]
Heck, I didn't even know what[N]
a Durian was till the trip![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm glad this journey has[N]
been so educational for you![AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah.[A] Truth be told,[AN]
after tryin' all[N]
these different foods[AN]
I'm realizin' that the stuff[N]
we ate back home was crap.[AN]
No one knew a thing or two[N]
about cookin' a proper meal.[AN]
We were in our own little[N]
world back there.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, when this is all over,[AN]
I'm sure you can take[N]
what you've learned[AN]
and show everyone back[N]
home a thing or two![AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat] when I get[Beat][N]
back home[Beat][A][X]

## FaolanFangai_A
[MidRight][LoadFangai]
[MidLeft][LoadFaolan]
Hey, Mr. Fangai, can I talk[N]
to you about something?[AN]
[MidRight]
Why certainly![AN]
[MidLeft]
Think I heard someone mention[N]
you're from Chouwouj, right?[AN]
Why'd you decide to leave[N]
and travel the world?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, that's quite the tale, but[N]
I left my home to separate[N]
myself from some rather[Beat][AN]
rambunctious fellows.[A] They were[N]
really pleasant people! But it[N]
was all too much to handle![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yeesh, that's some spooky stuff.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I was able to get out thanks[N]
to my dear friend Longxia![AN]
I had only intended to abscond[N]
for a short while,[AN]
but once I got a taste of the world[N]
beyond the borders of Chouwouj,[AN]
I knew that the journey[N]
must continue![AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh, ain't too different[N]
from me in a way.[AN]
We were both driven outta[N]
our homes by some trouble.[AN]
Then the whole wide world[N]
opened up and that was that.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
After going to all these place,[AN]
fightin' all these battles,[AN]
eatin' all sorts of food,[AN]
I[Beat] really wanna see[N]
more of the world.[AN]
There's so much out there[N]
that I can't find back home.[AN]
[CloseEyes]
But[Beat] I don't know if I[N]
can just up and do it.[AN]
I'm scared to leave behind[N]
everything back home.[AN]
It's all I've known,[AN]
and I don't know how I can[N]
turn my back on it all.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sometimes, the call of my homeland[N]
puts me into a sour mood.[AN]
But whenever I do get homesick,[AN]
I cook the meal that my parents[N]
would make me for breakfast,[AN]
and like that, I'm right back at home.[AN]
It helps me to remember that[N]
home isn't where you are,[AN]
it's who you are,[N]
your history.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN]
Heh, I think that[N]
settles it then.[AN][OpenEyes]
Hey, when this all this is[N]
said and done with,[AN]
could I come along on your[N]
boat and see the world?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh I'd be delighted![AN]
An aficionado of fine cusine[N]
is always welcome aboard![AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you so much, Mr. Fangai![AN]
I'll pull twice my weight[N]
and then some more![A][X]


## Fangai_Tippany_C

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight]Fangai, what are you making?[N]
I can smell it from miles away.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah, Tippany![N]
Just who I wanted to see.[AN]
I'm making a type of bone broth[N]
with some leftover chicken bones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Isn't that just a soup?[N]
I've never heard of this broth.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]All bone broths are soups,[N]
but not all soups are bone broths![AN]
You see the difference?[N]
I've heard bone broth is more nutritious,[AN]
a good way to stay in top shape![A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that something you learned[N]
from your time as a student of Cherne?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]My time as a student was[N]
something I prefer to forget,[AN]
but I cannot deny the skills I learned[N]
helped me a great deal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I'm sorry.[N]
I know it may not've been[Beat] pleasant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't worry, we can let the past[N]
be the past, Tippany.[AN]
Come, the soup is almost ready.[N]
Will you have some?[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] I have some questions[N]
about the seasoning,[AN]
but maybe I can try after the battle.[A][X]

## Fangai_Tippany_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]Fangai, what's wrong?[N]
I had trouble finding you today.[N]
There was no scent of cooked food.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh, Tippany, it was awful![N]
You remember the bone broth I made?[N]
The one you said was delicious?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Did I say that?[N]
I mean, yes, it was good.[N]
One of the better bone broths I've tried.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I was feeling confident[N]
after you shared this with me, and[N]
so I made another batch later on.[AN]
However, I made this soup for a[N]
special someone. Tippany, she may[N]
have even been [OpenQuote]the one"![A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]How do you mean, Fangai?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]She was the perfect woman.[N]
Tall, smart, interested in food,[N]
held good opinions, modestly wealthy[Beat][AN]
I could not ask for a better suitor![N]
But alas, it was all for naught.[N]
A total waste![A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]What happened?[N]
The soup didn't kill her, did it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]No! She said it was bland[N]
and uninteresting! She even insinuated[N]
that I, too, was the same![A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]How did you insinuate that?[N]
I'm sure she likes you![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]She said [OpenQuote]this broth of yours[N]
is bland and uninteresting, like you.[N]
It's over". Oh, I was destroyed![AN]
After you told me how much you liked[N]
the soup, I knew she would enjoy it.[N]
But alas, I misjudged! Stupid, stupid, stupid![A]
[OpenMidRight]Fangai, I'm sorry[Beat][N]
I know how much it can sting[N]
to be rejected[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Sniff[Beat] Excuse me, Tippany,[N]
but I need to be alone, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] I really should've told him it[N]
could've used more salt.[AN]
I need to make it up to him somehow.[N]
He was so sad[Beat][A][X]

## Fangai_Tippany_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFangai][OpenMidRight][LoadTippany]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Fangai, how are you feeling?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Terrible, awful, distraught,[N]
but most of all, incredibly lonely, Tippany.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is it about the soup hating woman?[N]
I'm sorry, Fangai.[AN]
I really am sorry.[N]
This is my fault.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You did nothing wrong, Tippany.[N]
This is entirely on me.[AN]
I'm the one who is unworthy of[N]
being loved[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]No, it is my fault.[N]
I lied to you.[AN]
I said the soup was delicious,[N]
but it was lacking in salt.[AN]
It could've been seasoned more.[N]
I shouldn't have lied.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Tippany[Beat] you're my friend.[N]
Why did you lie to me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I ask myself the same question.[N]
I suppose[Beat][AN]
I didn't want you to feel bad if[N]
I disliked something you made.[AN]
And it's not even like I disliked it![N]
It just needed some tweaks.[AN]
But[Beat] I am reminded of when I began[N]
to study the ways of Cherne.[AN]
Being a student gave me a sense of[N]
camraderie I'd never had before.[AN]
I was so desperate for friends,[N]
for any sort of human connection[Beat][AN]
I was willing to hold back how I felt[N]
to please others. Even now[Beat][AN]
I still struggle to be truthful.[N]
Fangai, I hope you understand.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I understand completely.[N]
Those who follow Cherne do so because[N]
they are lost and in need of a shepherd.[AN]
It is in our very nature to crave[N]
the companionship of others[Beat][N]
I forgive you, Tippany.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I never did ask you how you[N]
found yourself a student of Cherne.[N]
But I think I understand, now.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes[Beat] I'm just glad we are[N]
both out. Our own people now.[N]
But scars take time to heal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes[Beat] too long, in fact.[N]
But we will get better.[N]
I'm sorry about what happened. Really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Worry not, just tell me if it[N]
needs more salt next time, okay?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That I can do.[N]
Thanks, Fangai.[A][X]
