Heeeyyy, Varga![N]
Hold on a second![AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat] [Beat][A][MoveFarRight]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
Hey, you heard me, didn't you?[N]
Why are you shuffling away?[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
[Beat]We are on the battlefield, Emil.[N]
Now is not the time for idle words.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, c'mon. It's not like there's any[N]
enemies near us right now, yeah?[AN]
Besides, we're both Cytheans, y'know.[N]
What's the harm in a quick chat?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Quick, you say?[N]
Then get on with it.[N]
What did you call me for?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, I just wanted to ask a question.[AN]
You seem like an experienced fighter,[N]
so why do you bother with that armor?[N]
It seems like it only slows you down.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]If you think it's odd, explain.[N]
How do you think one should fight?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Me? Well, I think the best way is to[N]
avoid being struck in the first place.[AN]
For that, fielding a bunch of mounted[N]
troops makes the most sense, no?[AN]
They have the most flexible combat[N]
and can engage or disengage at will.[AN]
Maybe some strong fighters on foot[N]
can make the cut, but heavy armor[N]
just slows you down all the time.[AN]
What use is there in that?[N]
It makes you target practice, at best.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Think on it some more, lad.[N]
If this is the limit of your tactics,[N]
then we're lucky you're not the captain.[AN]
You'd get the lot of us killed.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
H-Huh? He just left like that?[N]
Well, I guess Varga's not much[N]
of a talker, but still, ouch.[AN]
Is there something I'm overlooking?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Fine then, I accept your challenge,[N]
Varga. I'll prove that I'm right![AN][X]

[FarFarLeft]
Hey, hey! Varga![N]
Slow down, will you?[N]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Ugh, again?[N]
Such a loud lad[Beat][AN]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, you didn't leave this time![AN]
I gave what you said some thought,[N]
really, but I'm struggling here.[AN]
I guess if we're indoors, we can't[N]
use our mounts for much, so maybe[N]
that armor's defense is worth it there.[AN]
Aside from that though, I can't see[N]
any reason to choose you over me.[AN]
[MidRight]
You seem to have not understood[N]
my answer, so let me give a hint.[N]
Is quicker necessarily better?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Huh? How could it not be?[N]
If you move fast, you can get the job[N]
done sooner and catch stray enemies.[AN]
[MidRight]
There's no guarantee you [OpenQuote]get it done"[N]
at all. Using that speed is liable[N]
to get you too far into enemy territory.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, I'll give that a quick pace can[N]
be risky too, but isn't that just more[N]
reason to deploy more mounted troops?[AN]
If there's enough of us, then we can[N]
all keep close and back each other up.[AN]
[MidRight]
And risk the entire army falling to[N]
weaponry designed to defeat you?[AN]
What do you do in that scenario?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, I'd just order all mounts[N]
to dismount, which lets us[Beat] Oh.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It lets you slow your pace, which is[N]
your only benefit over other options,[N]
and weakens your combat significantly.[AN]
At that point, you're a sitting duck.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, what's your counter, then?[N]
What benefits does that armor give?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Words don't seem to do you much good,[N]
so next time, I'll show you its purpose[N]
firsthand. Hopefully, that'll be enough.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Wait, Varga, hold on a-[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MidRight][ClearFace][MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, c'mon, not again![AN]
What kind of teacher leaves like that?[N]
Still, this was better than last time,[N]
so maybe he'll show me something good.[AN]
Heh[Beat] I'm looking forward to it.[A]

Hm[Beat] I don't see Varga anywhere.[AN]
He said to keep an eye on him this time,[N]
but[Beat] wait, is that Varga over there?[N]
Woah, he's surrounded by five enemies![AN]
I gotta back him up quick, or-[AN][MoveMidLeft]
Wait, their weapons are bouncing[N]
off him like they're nothing,[N]
and he's hitting 'em back hard![AN][MoveMidLeft]
This is[Beat] This is awesome![N]
With this, we can take 'em down easy![AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well? Was that enough of a showcase[N]
of why we armored soldiers are useful?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I mean, yeah, but you're in a class[N]
of your own, Varga! You're crazy![N]
How can you fight like that?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I was showing off a bit, but[Beat][N]
You see, this armor grants more than[N]
protection, Emil. It gives confidence.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
While I fight in this, I know that[N]
I am well-protected. Because of that,[N]
my sword never strays due to fear.[AN]
I can fight at my best, taking the[N]
brunt of the enemy charge and[N]
countering with blows of my own.[AN]
With this, my allies can finish the[N]
job. In fact, they can do it quickly.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I see. So due to that, you can[N]
move faster than the ideal mounted[N]
troop, without any of the negatives?[AN]
[MidRight]
More important than the speed,[N]
is that this method is safe, Emil.[AN]
The goal of any commander should be[N]
to complete the mission with as few[N]
casualties as possible in the process.[AN]
For that purpose, armored troops that[N]
can hold down the frontline are[N]
vital sentinels for the entire army.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I see. You're completely right,[N]
Varga. I only ever viewed combat[N]
from my own perspective[Beat][AN]
One where we mounted troops flank[N]
and charge at our own leisure.[AN]
But too many moving that selfishly can[N]
cause problems for the others, huh?[N]
I never looked at it that way.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yes. If a soldier on the frontline[N]
strays from their duty, then the entire[N]
army can collapse from this mistake.[AN]
I've[Beat] seen as much, in my own life.[AN]
My son took too much after his old man,[N]
when I was still zealous in my duty[N]
to Cythes as a soldier and knight.[AN]
His errors led to the deaths of his[N]
entire squad, including himself,[N]
all due to the pride he got from me.[AN]
[Beat]Keep a calm head always, Emil.[AN]
Death awaits any who don't.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I won't forget your words, sir.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Good. I'll return to the fight,[N]
so don't worry about the backline.[N]
I won't let a single enemy through![AN][X]
