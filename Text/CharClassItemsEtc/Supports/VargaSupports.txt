## Varga_Zwieback_C
[OpenMidLeft][LoadVarga][OpenMidRight][LoadZwieback]
[OpenMidRight]'Scuse me, young man,[N]
but I think you may've dropped this.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] How careless of me.[N]
Thanks for returning it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's a fine dagger.[N]
Would be saddened had I lost it.[AN]
I'm Zwieback, by the way.[N]
You're Lady Cleo's bodyguard?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Her tutor. You can call me Varga.[N]
Thank you for returning this to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Her tutor? You look like a trained[N]
soldier more than a teacher.[N]
I mean no offense, of course.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
None taken. Looks can be deceiving,[N]
after all. I helped her with both[N]
her letters and her fighting.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
A man of book and blade![N]
A rare combination, that's for sure.[N]
May ask for your help with my daughter.[AN]
Filone's picked up to the bow[N]
well-enough, like her old man,[N]
but can't count well at all.[AN]
She was never the best at spelling,[N]
either. Ah! I've been rambling too much,[N]
forgive me for muttering nonsense.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It's not a problem.[N]
[Beat] Let's get back to the battle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, that sure was abrupt.[N]
Guess he's not taking new students.[A][X]

## Varga_Zwieback_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadVarga][OpenMidRight][LoadZwieback]
[OpenMidRight]
Varga! Well met.[N]
This army's luck to have us both![AN]
Two strong, armored men to hold[N]
down the front lines.[AN]
It's been a great pleasure fighting[N]
alongside you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's no trouble, Zwieback. It's[N]
merely my duty.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Speaking of which, I gotta ask you.[AN]
Would you be open to teaching[N]
my daughter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] I don't think I'd have the time.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, I'm not asking as a favor.[N]
I'd gladly pay your for your time.[AN]
I don't have much, but nothing is[N]
more important to me than my daughter.[AN]
Fighting is a fine skill and all,[N]
but I'd like to see her do more.[AN]
You know, surpass me and my parents.[N]
Do something a bit more meaningful.[AN]
Maybe learn enough words and maths[N]
to start a business and live peacefully.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
I appreciate the offer, but really[Beat][N]
I don't think I'm best suited.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nonsense! Lady Cleo's one of the sharpest[N]
folk I've ever worked with![AN]
If you're her tutor as you say,[N]
surely you played a part in that.[AN]
I'm sorry if I'm being pushy,[N]
but as a father[Beat][AN]
I can't help but[N]
want what's best for Filone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes][Beat] As a father[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, as a father.[N]
You have kids, Varga?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Let's focus on the battle.[A][X]

## Varga_Zwieback_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadVarga][OpenMidRight][LoadZwieback]
[OpenMidRight]
Varga! There you are. I feel like[N]
you've been ignoring me.[AN]
I hope I wasn't too forward in my[N]
request for Filone's tutoring.[AN]
I just got excited knowing you'd done[N]
such a fine job teaching Lady Cleo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's no trouble, Zwieback.[N]
[Beat] I can understand that feeling.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You can?[N]
You have kids, Varga?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] I did have a son, once.[N]
He[Beat] passed away some time ago.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sorry to hear that, Varga.[N]
Was it disease that took him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No[Beat][N]
It was war.[AN]
We were fighting together.[N]
I watched my son die.[AN][CloseEyes]
Watched the life leave his eyes,[AN]
the fear on his face,[N]
knowing it was the end[Beat][AN]
It is burned into my memory.[N]
I'll never forget that agony.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Varga[Beat] I had no idea.[AN]
And here I am, being selfish[N]
about my own kin.[AN]
I didn't know you carried such[N]
a heavy burden.[AN]
It makes me want to keep Filone[N]
even closer than I already do.[AN]
Although I wish she didn't have[N]
to fight like her old man[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]
You're a good man, Zwieback.[N]
Filone is lucky to have you as a father.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
What was your son's name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat] Lyuben.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's a good name. A strong one.[N]
I'm sure he'd be proud to see you now.[AN]
See that you haven't given up[N]
after all you've been through.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph, maybe so.[N]
I won't know until I see him again.[AN]
Zwieback[Beat] continue to cherish Filone.[N]
In war[Beat][AN]
You can never be certain.[N]
The end can come at any time.[AN]
[Beat] Even sooner than you'd ever[N]
thought possible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'll do my best to protect her.[N]
The best I can do, I'll do for her.[AN]
And Varga[Beat][N]
one more thing for you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm?[N]
What is it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't imagine the pain you've endured.[N]
In fact, I don't want to imagine it.[AN]
But I also know these things[Beat][N]
They can be hard to carry on our own.[AN]
You're always off by yourself,[N]
sitting quiet, staying up late alone[Beat][AN]
I know how tough it can be to feel like[N]
you have to put on a strong face[Beat][AN]
If you ever need an ear,[N]
know that I'm here, alright?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Zwieback[Beat][N]
Thank you, my friend.[A][X]

## VargaEliasASupport
[MidLeft][LoadVarga]
[MidRight][LoadElias]
[MidLeft]
Sir Elias! Are you unharmed?[N]
Are you alright?![AN]
[MidRight]
W-What? I'm just fine, Varga.[N]
Why are you so panicked?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I just[Beat] I didn't know if[N]
you had made it out safely.[AN]
Those blasted catacombs[Beat][N]
And Leonidas's betrayal[Beat][N]
It's all hard to swallow.[A]
[MidRight]
My father was a man of many flaws[Beat][N]
but he loved us, didn't he?[AN]
He despaired after Cleo disappeared[N]
and begged that I bring her back.[AN]
So why[Beat] Why would he do this to us?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]He did love you both. Although[N]
he hardened after your mother passed,[N]
his feelings for you two never changed.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]He taught us to become strong so that[N]
we could protect what we cared for,[N]
so why[Beat] why would he not do the same?[AN]
He was stronger than Cleo[Beat] stronger[N]
than me[Beat] hell, stronger than Orfeas![AN]
Why wouldn't he fight to protect us?![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I learned much about Leonidas during[N]
our time together in the army. That[N]
strength was his weakness, Sir Elias.[AN]
His strength overwhelmed all others, but[N]
adversity is what builds a man's will[N]
to continue when things seem hopeless.[AN]
When he met a being so much stronger than[N]
himself, Byelen incarnate, he could never[N]
dream of facing him and surviving.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]All the strength in the world won't[N]
help one with a weak spirit, huh?[AN]
He always told us to do what we did[N]
because of the weight of our last name,[N]
so[Beat] was that all that drove him?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Indeed. His misguided sense of duty[N]
left him with nothing but his pride.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]If you knew all that, why stick[N]
with him? Out of your duty alone?[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]I already lost one son to war.[AN][OpenEyes]
If I left and something happened to you[N]
two, I[Beat] I could never forgive myself.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Varga[Beat] I'm eternally grateful that[N]
you stayed. And[Beat] if you're willing,[N]
I want you to stay by our side.[AN]
I intend to start a new knight order,[N]
one that will protect the peace of[N]
Cythes til it can stand on its own.[AN]
I can't think of a better[N]
subcommander than you, Varga.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Truly?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes. I[Beat] We all still need you, Varga.[N]
Don't hang up your sword just yet.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Unless you think you're too old?[A]
[MidLeft]
Ha! I'm still young enough to show[N]
novices like you the right way to fight.[AN]
If you'll have me, Commander Elias.[A]
[MidRight]
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.[AN]
We can decide the specifics later, but[N]
today, the Order of Coralia is born![A][X]
