Delilah! It's good to[N]
see you're doing well.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No thanks to you.[A][N]
What're you here to[N]
preach about this time?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There's something I've[N]
been meaning to ask you.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Why are you still fighting[N]
with the Liberators' army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You kept ranting about[N]
hating me and hating our[N]
cause back in the dungeons.[A][N]
You had your chance to run back[N]
to Vetheim after we made it out.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And yet you're still here,[N]
in Loewe and Cleo's army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
That's none of your business.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me,[N]
we're still in the[N]
middle of a battle.[A][N]
I'd rather focus on that.[A][X]

Hah![A] Hyah![A][N]
Take that, dogs of Cythes![A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're not actually casting[N]
any magic, you know that?[A][N]
Just waving your staff around.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I suppose not, but[N]
it's fun to feel included.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You do you, I guess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Actually, while[N]
you're here, Delilah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Make it quick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
A while back, I asked you why[N]
you're still with the army.[A][N]
That's even more important here,[N]
now that all of Decia is free.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Oh Byelen, not this again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm still in the army to protect[N]
Byelen's chosen throughout Orodreth,[A][N]
and to further punish the Cytheans[N]
for their crimes against my home.[A][N]
But I know you don't[N]
care much about that.[A][N]
What truly is it[N]
that keeps you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's[Beat][A] well[Beat][A] um[Beat][A][N]
Look, if I knew, I'd tell you.[A][N]
But I don't know, so I can't.[A][N]
We're not having this[N]
conversation, all right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]

What just happened?[A][X]

Is there something on[N]
your mind, Delilah?[A][N]
You've been avoiding me[N]
more than usual as of late.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Did my pestering strike[N]
too much of a nerve?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]No. It's not that.[A][N]
I guess I should say I'm sorry[N]
for what happened earlier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's[Beat] honestly a bit[N]
out of character for you.[A][N]
But in any case,[N]
I accept your apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]Let me explain.[A][N]
Honestly, the reason I'm[N]
still fighting with the army?[A][N]
It's because of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
There, I said it.[N]
Can I go now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, if you must, but[N]
I'd really rather you stay[N]
here a moment to explain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Fine.[A][N]
If I went back to Decia,[N]
I'd have to go back[N]
to the abbey in Vetheim.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Are you worried about[N]
Abbess Gloria? She's-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
She's a traitor and a[N]
madwoman, is what she is.[A][N]
So much a [OpenQuote]pacifist" that she[N]
supported Duke Cidor's betrayal.[A][N]
I saw her helping the soldiers when[N]
they arrested us at the protest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You're a fool, Svetomir.[N]
A damned fool.[A][N]
But you risked your life[N]
to break me out of prison.[A][N]
I'll be damned if I won't[N]
choose that over Gloria's[N]
turning on me any day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]It was my pleasure, Delilah.[A][N]
I'm glad to have a fellow devotee[N]
of Byelen - and a friend - like you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Are we really [OpenQuote]friends"?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Maybe?[A][X]
