Hm[Beat]No, this isn't enough yet.[N]
I just need a bit more[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadAlena]
Well well, if it isn't Svet.[N]
What are you muttering about?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, Alena. I'm just reviewing my saved[N]
gold and seeing how much more I need.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh really? Let me take a look[Beat][N][ToggleSmile]
Whoa, that's huge! How did Spendthrift[N]
Svet save up that big a pile of gold?[AN][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]And why hasn't he paid me back yet,[N]
if he's hoarding that much of it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Er[Beat] I'll have that money soon, Alena,[N]
really. As for my savings, I didn't[N]
do anything special to get this much.[AN]
I've stopped going to the tavern as[N]
often, I don't pick up exotic cheeses[N]
that I see in the market anymore[Beat][AN]
Honestly, life's been pretty dull,[N]
but it'll all be worth it in the end.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Wow, that does sound dire. Who took[N]
the Svet I know and love so well[N]
and changed him beyond recognition?[AN]
You're almost acting like a man[N]
of the cloth right now, Svet[Beat][N]
Or should I call you Father Svetomir?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha ha, very funny. No, I suspect that[N]
even if I wanted you to address me with[N]
respect, you'd continue on anyway.[AN]
[MidRight]
If that's really what you want, I'd try,[N]
but old habits die hard, and I'm much[N]
more used to the two of us being equals.[AN]
[Beat]Say, even with that saving of yours,[N]
this is still an awful lot of money.[AN]
Are you doing mercenary work again?[N]
I thought you were done with that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I thought I was too, but there's no[N]
other option that paid well enough[N]
and was flexible for our work here.[AN]
Inbetween missions, I've been going[N]
on a few of my own and plying my trade.[AN]
Healers are always in high demand.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, you lot are definitely paid most,[N]
but[Beat] I'd never seen you so scared[N]
as you were after that last job.[AN]
You must really need that money[N]
if you're taking clients again.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yeah, but I'm close to being done,[N]
for good. One more job, and I'll have[N]
enough for what I owe you and the rest.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Svet, if it's too much right now,[N]
you don't have to pay it back.[AN]
I don't want to put a friend out.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You've done more than enough, Alena,[N]
so don't worry about it. I gotta pay it[N]
soon, or this saving was for nothing.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? What d'you mean by that?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Eh, forget it. We can talk about it[N]
after I'm done saving up the gold.[AN]
For now, let's just get back to work.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadSvetomir]
Alena, are there any enemies nearby?[N]
If not, can we have a word?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh? Oh, no, I don't see anyone.[N]
What's with the formalities?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I've got all the gold I owe you,[N]
so I figured I'd hand it over now[N]
since I saw you were nearby.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Um, look, I appreciate that,[N]
but is this really the right time?[AN]
We are on a battlefield, y'know.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, but I've got something else[N]
for you, and I can't see any better[N]
place to hand it over than here.[AN]
There's[Beat] too many people[N]
watching around the barracks.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That sounds ominous[Beat] Well, don't[N]
keep me in suspense. Hand it over![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Would it kill you to learn some patience?[N]
I swear, you haven't changed a bit[Beat][N]
Hold on, let me unwrap it first.[AN][MoveMidRight][.7][MoveMidRight]
That should do it. I wanted to make[N]
sure it didn't get chipped before[N]
it could make it to your hands.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Wait, this glimmer is[Beat][N]
Could this be a Selesian sapphire?[AN]
It's just like the one I had before![AN]
[MidRight]
Right you are. Honestly, it was hard[N]
to find, but I spared no effort in[N]
choosing the best birthday present![AN]
[MidLeft]
My birthday? [Beat]Oh, that's right![N]
With everything happening,[N]
I'd almost forgotten it passed.[AN]
So that's what you were saving up for[Beat][AN]
Tell me, how'd you know that I would[N]
even want this? I don't rememember[N]
mentioning it to you beforehand.[AN]
[MidRight]
You didn't, but on our last mission[N]
together as mercenaries, I remember[N]
you losing something quite similar.[AN]
I never knew why, but you were[N]
quite distraught about the situation.[AN]
And, well, you've done so much for me,[N]
and without you, I would have died[N]
on that last job without a doubt.[AN]
I owed you much more than a hundred[N]
gold[Beat] So, I wanted to pay the debt.[AN]
I know it can't replace what you lost,[N]
but hopefully, it helps in some way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I guess I never told you why, huh?[N]
Well, you deserve to know now, at least.[AN]
That sapphire[Beat] Honestly, I don't like[N]
gems very much. They break easy, and[N]
you have to always be careful with them.[AN]
But that one[Beat] It was my last keepsake[N]
of my mother before she passed away.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] I had no idea it had such value.[AN]
Please, if you find this one wanting,[N]
you don't have to take it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, I really do appreciate it.[N]
It's not the same one, but[Beat][N]
I already feel at ease holding it.[AN]
Thanks, Svet. You're the best friend[N]
I could ever ask for, and I hope[Beat][N]
I hope we stay that way forever.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wouldn't have it any other way.[AN]
When we return to the base,[N]
let's drink to that, forevermore![AN]
[MidLeft]
Sounds good to me, but[N]
you're buying this time![AN][X]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Why are you still fighting[N]
with the Liberators' army?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You kept ranting about[N]
hating me and hating our[N]

You had your chance to run back[N]
to Vetheim after we made it out.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And yet you're still here,[N]
in Loewe and Cleo's army.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
That's none of your business.[A][N]
Now if you'll excuse me,[N]
we're still in the[N]

[Beat]Actually, while[N]
you're here, Delilah.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Make it quick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
A while back, I asked you why[N]
you're still with the army.[A][N]
That's even more important here,[N]
now that all of Decia is free.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Oh Byelen, not this again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm still in the army to protect[N]
Byelen's chosen throughout Orodreth,[A][N]
and to further punish the Cytheans[N]
for their crimes against my home.[A][N]
But I know you don't[N]
care much about that.[A][N]
What truly is it[N]
that keeps you here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's[Beat][A] well[Beat][A] um[Beat][A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Did my pestering strike[N]

I guess I should say I'm sorry[N]
for what happened earlier.[A]

That's[Beat] honestly a bit[N]
out of character for you.[A][N]
But in any case,[N]
I accept your apology.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]Let me explain.[A][N]
Honestly, the reason I'm[N]
still fighting with the army?[A][N]
It's because of you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
There, I said it.[N]
Can I go now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, if you must, but[N]
I'd really rather you stay[N]
here a moment to explain.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Fine.[A][N]
If I went back to Decia,[N]
I'd have to go back[N]

Sir Svetomir! What a fine day this is,[N]
eh? To fight side by side with another[N]
servant of Byelen is my greatest wish![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Zhara. A servant of Byelen is a[N]
lofty title I don't meet, but it is[N]
nice to have another who understands.[AN]
Though I cannot blame them for it,[N]
most of our company aren't familiar[N]
with the sacred texts like you must be.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I have great respect for you paladins,[N]
and I can only imagine how difficult[N]
it must have been to become one.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Uh[Beat][ToggleSmile] You are too kind, Svetomir.[AN]
Yes, my trials were surely arduous,[N]
but I succeeded, thanks to our lord![AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed, indeed. I've heard of many[N]
holy orders, but very few of them[N]
reside in Decia these days.[AN]
On the other hand, Mahemen has aplenty.[AN]
At one time, I wanted to join the ranks[N]
of the Crossblades, the Silver Shields,[N]
or even the Knights of the Grey[Beat][AN]
Ah, that's right. What knight order did[N]
you belong to, Zhara? With your skill,[N]
it must have been an influential one.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Er, is that an enemy in the distance?[N]
Apologies, fine priest, but I must end[N]
our talk here. Blessed be our lord![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] That enemy is awfully far.[N]
Was it really necessary to charge?[AN]
Well, she is the paladin, so[Beat][N]

past holy work another time.[AN][X]

Zhara! Just who I wanted to see.[AN]

but I couldn't find you anywhere.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, that is awfully strange.[N]
What was it you wanted to ask?[AN]

It's about your old order. Which one[N]
did you join to become this skilled?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat][N]
That is[Beat] Er[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Hm? Could you speak a bit louder,[N]
Zhara? I can't hear a thing.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My holy order was a bit obscure,[N]
you see. It's not one many would know,[N]
even one as learned as yourself.[AN]
And, well, I never[Beat] exactly earned[N]
the rank of paladin, so to speak.[AN]
But I trained as hard as any other![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Is it so obscure as to not exist?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Sadly, yes.[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't understand[Beat] If you had that[N]
level of skill, why not work to become[N]
a real one? It makes no sense, Zhara.[AN]
[MidLeft]
In truth, I[Beat][N]
I failed the written test.[AN]
[MidRight]
You what? How? Isn't that[N]
the easiest out of them all?[AN]

I just[Beat] I'm not particularly[N]

No matter how many times I try to read[N]
over those old, dusty, boring books,[N]
my eyes just glaze over completely![AN]
Where's the excitement, sir priest?![AN]

Hold a moment, Sir Svetomir![AN]
I[Beat] I know my falsehood disappointed[N]

I heard the most tragic piece of news[N]
recently. Is it true that our lord[N]
Byelen is the enemy after all?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Were you fighting under a rock?[N]
Yes, that's been our goal all this time.[AN]
Did the commanders not tell you?[N]
Well, even if they didn't, how did you[N]
not notice after all that's happened?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Woe![A] Agony![A] To think that our[N]
lord has betrayed us so callously![AN]
My heart feels as if it will shatter.[AN]
[MidRight]
Despite your[Beat] dramatics, I feel the[N]
same. I won't lie, I haven't dedicated[N]
my whole life to the cloth alone.[AN]
I was once a mercenary, a good one.[N]
But now, priesthood is a part of me[Beat][N]
What am I to do after Byelen's gone?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, mercenaries aren't so different[N]
from paladins, right? Let's do that![AN]
We can travel across Orodreth and seek[N]
out our destiny while getting paid[N]
to do it. Sounds good to my ears![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What exactly is a mercenary's[N]
destiny? To die in some ditch,[N]
for an employer that doesn't care?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, of course not! In all the stories,[N]
mercenaries are brave warriors who[N]
fight for their friends and family![AN]
Sure, you might have to pay them,[N]
but they're good guys deep down, right?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Uh, sure. Well, you're a good[N]
fighter, and I've got nothing better[N]
to do, so why not? Let's be partners.[AN]
