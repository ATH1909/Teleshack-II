Hey, Volran![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Tara! how's the army thing[N]
holding up for you?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm doing fine.[A] Are you making[N]
any progress on your magic?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
If I'm being honest[Beat][AN]
Not as well as before.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, if you're stuck, you[N]
could try the sword again.[AN]
Your speed was unmatched![AN]
But now that you're spending[N]
all that time casting, you-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes]Tara, I'm fine. I[Beat][N]
I can do this.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey, wait![AN][MoveMidRight]
Ugh[Beat] why can't he just[N]
stick to what he's good at?[A][X]

Oh, uh[Beat][N]
Hey there, Tara.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Whaddya need?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Can you answer me honestly?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
'Course I can![.4] What's up?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Do you think I'm good[N]
at magic? Like, seriously?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, well[Beat]
For one, you're undeniably[N]
very passionate about it.[AN]
On top of that, you've poured[N]
over any material you could fi-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's not my question.[.4][N]
[CloseEyes]Tara, am I good at magic?[A][OpenEyes]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Um, I think you're[N]
doing well[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
So that's a no.[AN]
I should've expected that,[N]
if I'm being honest.[AN]
I mean, you've always badgered[N]
me about giving up the sword.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] guess I have.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Alright, I've gotta go.[N]
Thanks for answering.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
Well, now I feel terrible.[A][X]

Tara?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Can I ask you about something?[N]
I'd like an honest answer.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]sure.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Why are you so interested in[N]
magic? I'm not trying to dig[N]
at you, I'm just curious.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] don't actually know.[AN]
It just feels so[Beat] necessary?[N]
I don't know how to put it, but I[N]
just can't imagine giving it up.[AN]
Especially not for the sword.[N]
If I ever pick it up again, I'm[N]
going to learn it from scratch.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I see.[AN]
This probably doesn't mean much,[N]
but I'm sorry for pestering you.[AN]
I didn't realize how much it[N]
must've stung to hear.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
It's[Beat] fine.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
For the record, I think you're[N]
well on your way to matching[N]
even some high-level mages.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]really?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, absolutely![AN]
Did you even realize how[N]
proficient you've gotten with[N]
tomes in such a short time?[AN]
You can even use some extremely[N]
high-level magic, just 'cause[N]
you decided you wanted to![AN]
It might not be a typical[N]
form of mastery, but it's great,[N]
and it definitely suits you.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Honestly, thank you for[N]
those kind words, Tara.[AN]
I'll keep going.[N]
I'll push my magic farther.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Don't mention it.[A][X]
