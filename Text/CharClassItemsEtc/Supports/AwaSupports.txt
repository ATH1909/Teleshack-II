## Awa_Nikolas_C

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
Ah, Awa! I have a most truly and really[N]
important question to ask of you![A]
[MidLeft]
Now? In the middle of the battlefield?[N]
Can't it wait until, you know[Beat] later?[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! No! Listen to me![N]
What is your horse's name?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] My horse.[A]
[MidRight]
Your horse![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Alright, sure, I'll bite.[AN]
This big guy's name is Puru; now I[N]
get to ask a question of my own.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, I'm very bad at answering things[Beat][N]
But I have to do what's right[Beat][AN]
I'll do my best! Ask away![A]
[MidLeft]
Just[Beat] Why do you want to know so bad?[A]
[MidRight]
Well, you see, everyone I've known who[N]
rides horses knows their horse's name![AN]
Novices, veterans, even the man who[N]
sells them on the farm! But! How!?[A]
[MidLeft]
How? What do you mean how?[A]
[MidRight]
Me and my steed[Beat] we've been through[N]
the worst mankind has to offer, we have.[AN]
We've seen it all;[A] War;[A] Ummmm;[A] and[N]
yet, despite the bond we now share[Beat][AN]
He still won't tell me his name![AN]
How did you convince your horse to spill[N]
the beans, huh? Please, I have to know![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] [A]Alright, I'm leaving.[A][X]

## Awa_Nikolas_B

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
[MidLeft]
How long do you intend on following at[N]
my heels like a sad puppy, Nikolas?[A]
[MidRight]
Until I get my answers! Now, tell me![AN]
Did he speak to you in Horsese, or do[N]
they secretly speak Human!? Or[Beat] my god[Beat][AN]
What if WE speak Horsese and THEY[N]
speak Human? That would be crazy[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I'm not so sure you speak either, Nik.[AN]
Now stop pestering me with this stupid[N]
nonsense when there's a war to wage.[A]
[MidRight]
But that's just it! Without my steed's[N]
name gracing my lips, I'm left adrift![AN]
How is a man to fight when he who he[N]
fights alongside is a stranger to him!?[AN]
Please, Awa, as my closest and dearest[N]
friend, surely you understand me here?[A]
[MidLeft]
[OpenQuote]Closest and dearest friend?" That's[Beat][N]
pretty sad, actually. Ah, sheesh, man[Beat][AN]
Okay, whatever. I'll humour you. Horses[N]
can't talk Nikolas. They're just horses.[A]
[MidRight]
No[Beat] No, that's not possible[Beat][AN]
Awa, this is surely one of your famous[N]
comedies, right? Just some harmless fun?[AN]
You can't possibly be telling me that[N]
my greatest companion is JUST a horse[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Uh[Beat] that's exactly what I said.[AN]
I came up with Puru's name myself. He's[N]
a good boy, so I gave him a good name.[A]
[MidRight]
A[Beat] good[Beat] name?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yeah. He's named after the strongest man[N]
I know, you know? And that's my brother.[AN]
I taught him how to ride and how to[N]
swing a stick around when we were kids,[AN]
and he taught me to read and write in[N]
return. The big guy[Beat] he's the same.[AN]
You can see it in his eyes sometimes;[AN]
he's just a big sweetheart, and for a[N]
horse, he's pretty clever, I'd say.[AN]
He kinda reminds me of home in that way.[A]
[MidRight]
So you named him after a person you[N]
admired? His mom didn't name him?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, Nikolas. The horse's mom, who was[N]
also a horse, did not name this horse.[A]
[MidRight]
You've given me much food for thought![AN]
Okay, then; the next time we meet, I'll[N]
have given my steed a most wondrous name![A][X]


## Awa_Nikolas_A

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
Ahaha! Tell me, Awa, have you noticed[N]
anything[Beat] different about us lately?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your smile is, somehow, brighter.[N]
I hate it. Is it because of the horse?[A]
[MidRight]
Gasp! Shock and horror! Awa, he is not[N]
[OpenQuote]the horse!" This steed has a name, now![A]
[MidLeft]
I had a feeling that would be it. Okay,[N]
spill it; what's this one's name, then?[A]
[MidRight]
Nikolas![A]
[MidLeft]
No, not you. I meant the horse.[A]
[MidRight]
Gasp! I thought I told you not to call[N]
him [OpenQuote]the horse" like that! How rude![A]
[MidLeft]
Please stop saying "gasp" like that[Beat][AN]
And, are you telling me you named[N]
your own horse after yourself?[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! I was once told I lived a most[N]
admirably, blissfully ignorant life![AN]
And you told me I should name him after[N]
somebody I admire! It just makes sense![A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] have to respect the confidence.[AN]
But aren't you worried about sharing[N]
a name being sort of[Beat] confusing?[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, Awa, surely you know by now that[N]
I would be confused regardless![A]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] shockingly self-aware of you.[AN]
You sort of come across as perpetually[N]
baffled. It's quite charming, really.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! It's true! Like today, I am baffled[N]
by yet another horse question![A]
[MidLeft]
Oh? This sounds like it'll be fun;[N]
What's today's horse question?[A]
[MidRight]
Your friend[Beat] he is wingless! Why?[N]
When will Puru hatch his adult wings?[AN]
And are you sure it's moral to bring a[N]
child horse along to the battlefield!?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] I changed my mind. Not fun enough.[N]
I'll talk to you later, Nikolas.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Yes! I will also talk to you later![AN]
Or[Beat] wait[Beat] was she talking to you,[N]
Nikolas? My god, so I was right[Beat][AN]
She DOES speak Horsese after all[Beat][A][X]

## Awa_Zhara_C
[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadZhara]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hey, new girl.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah! Hello! I assume you're[N]
speaking to me, yes?[A]
[MidLeft]
Who else would I be speaking to?[N]
D'you mind if I ask you something?[A]
[MidRight]
Of course not! Er, unless it's[N]
one of those[Beat] bad questions.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I dunno what a bad question is,[N]
but I just wanted to ask about[N]
your fighting style real quick.[AN]
You're self taught, aren't you?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Y-you can tell just from watching me?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sure I can. I've seen plenty of knight[N]
types in my day, but you're different.[AN]
Your swings are less practices, but also[N]
better suited to your fighting habits.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Oh? So[Beat] you approve, then?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hell no. You're wide open after every[N]
dumbass swing you make. The only reason[N]
you're alive is because your foes suck.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
A-ah, I see. Quite bluntly put, Lady[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft]
Just Awa. None of that Lady or Dame crap.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Alright, then. Just Awa it is. Who are[N]
you to criticize the form of a paladin[N]
of Byelen? Self taught or otherwise,[AN]
I am a holy warrior, and fight with[N]
all the fervour of Byelen himself![A]
[MidLeft]
Please, don't make me laugh. You're no[N]
holier than me, and Byelen would smite me[N]
dead if he had half a care to notice me.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Are you calling me a liar?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] No? But I am now. Come to think[N]
of it, what kind of paladin is untrained?[AN]
Say, what order are you a part of?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
W-why, Awa, is it not obvious from the[N]
crest on my hauberk that I serve the[N]
holy order of[Beat] the D-Dawn[Beat] uh[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
The Order of the Long Dawn? Or do you[N]
mean the Dawn Riders? Maybe the Dawn[N]
Knights? Or perhaps just the Dawnites?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
U-uh, were those last two not the same?[AN]
A-and I'm obviously referring to the,[N]
ah[Beat] the Dawn Riders! It's obvious.[AN]
I ride a horse, after all![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, really? 'Cause I made that one up.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah? Ah[Beat] ha! Aha! I've caught you![AN]
I knew you were attempting to deceive[N]
me, so I've merely called your bluff![AN]
I'm obviously one of the Dawn Knights![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Also made up.[A]
[MidRight]
T-the Dawnites, I meant to say![A]
[MidLeft]
I made them all up.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Y-you[Beat] blackguard! I will not be[N]
mocked by such a brazen fiend![AN]
I will fight precisely as I always have![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Your funeral, lady. Hey, by the way;[AN]
that symbol is for an order of knights[N]
that doesn't exist anymore. Makes it[N]
really easy to tell that you're a fake.[AN]
Anyway, see ya 'round, [OpenQuote]O Holy Warrior!"[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] So she knew the whole time?[A][X]

## Awa_Zhara_B

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadZhara]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I see you've been working on your form.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah! Awa! I-I[Beat] I mean, of course![AN]
A hero must always hone their craft,[N]
blessed or otherwise! It's only natural.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mhm, and that's why you practiced the[N]
exact thing I told you was lacking?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You merely identified that which I was[N]
already working to improve. A keen eye,[N]
to be sure, but proof of little else![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Riiiight. Say, where'd you find that[N]
fancy armour of yours, anyhow?[AN]
Didja kill for it? Or just steal it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Heavens forbid! No, I was granted this[N]
by[Beat] a member of the order, prior[N]
to its dissolution. I am the last one![A]
[MidLeft]
Cut the crap, Zhara. They would never[N]
knight your ass. Maybe some of these[N]
other orders, but not that one.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Oh? You don't think I'm good enough?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, I don't. I think you're a rat.[N]
A helpful rat, but a rat all the same.[AN]
Trying to leverage the hard work of dead[N]
men to give yourself an ego boost. Pah.[AN]
It's disgusting.[A]
[MidRight]
Dead men? I[Beat] Awa, did you[Beat][N]
know these knights before they[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Before they what, Zhara? Died?[AN]
Yeah, I knew a couple of 'em. Why?[N]
Curious to know exactly whose legacy[N]
you're trampling with this charade?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm just surprised. You don't seem[N]
the type to have knightly connections.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, unlike you, right? The noble hero,[N]
wearing armour she took off a corpse.[AN]
Is that where the sword came from, too?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, of course not. This sword, it's[Beat][AN]
I mean, you wouldn't get it. You already[N]
think my whole story's a total sham.[AN]
But this[Beat] this is my destiny.[AN]
I've had it since long before I even[N]
left my old home. Since[Beat] as long as[N]
I can even remember, being honest.[A]
[MidLeft]
A likely story. You don't even know[N]
the name of the order you're pretending[N]
to be a part of; how can I trust you?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] What was it?[A] Their name, I mean.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] [OpenQuote]Theirs was the Devotee Order of[N]
the Lion. Theirs was the noblest of all[N]
causes. Theirs were the noblest of souls.[AN]
And theirs will be the longest of vigils,[N]
as they leave us now to watch over all[N]
from atop Byelen's golden kingdom."[AN]
[CloseEyes]From a eulogy held in the capital.[AN]
[OpenEyes]A hundred and twelve knights left[N]
that week to defend the Decian border[N]
from the Cythean invaders. And[Beat][AN]
a hundred and twelve graves were dug[N]
for them, the day of that speech.[AN]
Empty, of course.[A] The bodies[Beat][N]
they were never found in the end.[AN]
Picked apart by crows. A hundred and[N]
twelve men, Zhara; reduced to carrion.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] I-I[Beat] Awa, I-[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Do you think you've done right by their[N]
memory, Zhara? Do you think you deserve[N]
to bear their sigil on your chest?[AN]
Would they be proud if they knew that[N]
their standard was born in ignorance by[N]
one such as you? I don't think so.[AN]
The Devotee Order of the Liar;[N]
THAT is your order, Zhara, and no[N]
pilfered armour can change that.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
But Awa-![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Think about that, would you?[N]
Might learn you something useful.[AN]
And keep working on your form;[N]
it's still sloppy and careless.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
But I'm[Beat] I'm not lying[Beat][N]
Not this time[Beat][A][X]

## Awa_Zhara_A

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadZhara][OneLineBox]
Awa, I need to talk to you.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, I don't need to talk to you.[AN]
I thought I made my feelings about[N]
you and your facade crystal clear.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I can prove it.[A]
[MidLeft]
Prove what?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I told you last time we spoke![AN]
This armour[Beat] it was gifted to me[N]
by a member of the Order of Lions.[AN]
I[Beat] I was never a member myself.[N]
I admit it. But I didn't steal this.[AN]
It was given to me, explicitly to[N]
carry on the legacy of the order.[A]
[MidLeft]
How do you expect to prove that?[N]
Everyone who would have known is dead.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I have a name.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Puru.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove].[.7].[.7].[.7] [ToggleMouthMove]You're lying.[A]
[MidRight]
I'm not! That was his name![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I don't believe you. Where did[N]
you hear that name? Answer me![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
He gave it to me when he gave me the-[A]
[MidLeft]
Stop lying to me![A]
[MidRight]
I'm not, damn it! Listen to me![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A] [CloseEyes][Beat] Fine.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Tell me everything.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Why do you care so-[A]
[MidLeft]
Zhara![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
R-right. I[Beat] lived on the border[N]
in my youth. I'd always wanted to be[N]
a healer, so when the war started[Beat][AN]
I was young, but I offered my help.[AN]
Yet we had no way of predicting just[N]
how badly we were outnumbered that day.[AN]
I tried[Beat] so hard, but I couldn't[Beat][AN]
Their wounds were deep, but the worst[N]
part was that they were so[Beat] broken.[AN]
I think we knew after that battle that[N]
Decia was lost. And broken men[Beat] you[N]
can't heal that. It's impossible.[AN]
You need to want it; You need to[N]
fight for life. And they[Beat] wouldn't.[AN]
They couldn't. But I still tried.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One of them[Beat] he was just a boy.[AN]
Barely any older than I was.[AN]
He survived for days, but the wounds[N]
wouldn't close. And he'd tell me[Beat][AN]
He said I was a hero.[A] Me.[A] The failure.[AN]
The one letting a boy die in a room full[N]
of the rest of his dying friends, far[N]
from home with no hope for survival.[AN]
And his name was Puru.[A] And he gave me[N]
this[Beat][A] and asked me bring it home.[AN]
But he never told me where home was.[AN]
It wasn't too much longer before the[N]
Cytheans won, and under the occupation,[AN]
there was little way to find the truth[N]
of where to return the armour to.[AN]
Eventually, I just[Beat] gave up.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A][OpenEyes] Then what?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] decided to prove that boy right.[AN]
I'm no hero. But I could be. With this[N]
sword, and his armour[Beat] his blessing[Beat][AN]
I can be who he needed me to be, all[N]
those years ago, when it counted most.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [A][CloseEyes]I see.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
So[Beat] that's my story. And it's[N]
true, all of it. I swear to you.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] [Beat] [Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]You don't have to worry about[N]
the hauberk. It's yours now.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Huh?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
He asked you to bring it home.[N]
If he knew where that was, he would[N]
have told you as much. He didn't.[AN]
He trusted you to give it a new[N]
one. A place that sigil belongs.[AN]
And you did. So don't worry about it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I don't understand[Beat] you[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
If you wanna do right by him and the[N]
others, keep practicing your footwork.[AN]
Help 'em[Beat] see that world they were[N]
fighting to save. You know what I mean?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I do. And I will. I swear it![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Good. Now, no more dwelling on the[N]
past; back to the fighting, eh?[A]
[MidRight]
Right, of course. I[Beat] um[Beat][AN]
[ToggleSmile]T-thank you, Awa. I'm sorry for-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hey now, I thought I told you to beat it![A]
[MidRight]
R-right! Sorry! Back to work![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] [A][CloseEyes]Puru[Beat] I hope you're[N]
watching. I'll make this right.[AN]
Tell Mom and Dad I'm not coming[N]
up to visit any time soon, yeah?[AN]
[OpenEyes]I've[Beat] got people to protect[Beat][A][X]
