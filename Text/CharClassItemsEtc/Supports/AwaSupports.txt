[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
Ah, Awa! I have a most truly and really[N]
important question to ask of you![A]
[MidLeft]
Now? In the middle of the battlefield?[N]
Can't it wait until, you know[Beat] later?[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! No! Listen to me![N]
What is your horse's name?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] My horse.[A]
[MidRight]
Your horse![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Alright, sure, I'll bite.[AN]
This big guy's name is Puru; now I[N]
get to ask a question of my own.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, I'm very bad at answering things[Beat][N]
But I have to do what's right[Beat][AN]
I'll do my best! Ask away![A]
[MidLeft]
Just[Beat] Why do you want to know so bad?[A]
[MidRight]
Well, you see, everyone I've known who[N]
rides horses knows their horse's name![AN]
Novices, veterans, even the man who[N]
sells them on the farm! But! How!?[A]
[MidLeft]
How? What do you mean how?[A]
[MidRight]
Me and my steed[Beat] we've been through[N]
the worst mankind has to offer, we have.[AN]
We've seen it all;[A] War;[A] Ummmm;[A] and[N]
yet, despite the bond we now share[Beat][AN]
He still won't tell me his name![AN]
How did you convince your horse to spill[N]
the beans, huh? Please, I have to know![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] [A]Alright, I'm leaving.[A][X]

## Awa_Nikolas_B

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
[MidLeft]
How long do you intend on following at[N]
my heels like a sad puppy, Nikolas?[A]
[MidRight]
Until I get my answers! Now, tell me![AN]
Did he speak to you in Horsese, or do[N]
they secretly speak Human!? Or[Beat] my god[Beat][AN]
What if WE speak Horsese and THEY[N]
speak Human? That would be crazy[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I'm not so sure you speak either, Nik.[AN]
Now stop pestering me with this stupid[N]
nonsense when there's a war to wage.[A]
[MidRight]
But that's just it! Without my steed's[N]
name gracing my lips, I'm left adrift![AN]
How is a man to fight when he who he[N]
fights alongside is a stranger to him!?[AN]
Please, Awa, as my closest and dearest[N]
friend, surely you understand me here?[A]
[MidLeft]
[OpenQuote]Closest and dearest friend?" That's[Beat][N]
pretty sad, actually. Ah, sheesh, man[Beat][AN]
Okay, whatever. I'll humour you. Horses[N]
can't talk Nikolas. They're just horses.[A]
[MidRight]
No[Beat] No, that's not possible[Beat][AN]
Awa, this is surely one of your famous[N]
comedies, right? Just some harmless fun?[AN]
You can't possibly be telling me that[N]
my greatest companion is JUST a horse[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Uh[Beat] that's exactly what I said.[AN]
I came up with Puru's name myself. He's[N]
a good boy, so I gave him a good name.[A]
[MidRight]
A[Beat] good[Beat] name?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yeah. He's named after the strongest man[N]
I know, you know? And that's my brother.[AN]
I taught him how to ride and how to[N]
swing a stick around when we were kids,[AN]
and he taught me to read and write in[N]
return. The big guy[Beat] he's the same.[AN]
You can see it in his eyes sometimes;[AN]
he's just a big sweetheart, and for a[N]
horse, he's pretty clever, I'd say.[AN]
He kinda reminds me of home in that way.[A]
[MidRight]
So you named him after a person you[N]
admired? His mom didn't name him?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, Nikolas. The horse's mom, who was[N]
also a horse, did not name this horse.[A]
[MidRight]
You've given me much food for thought![AN]
Okay, then; the next time we meet, I'll[N]
have given my steed a most wondrous name![A][X]


## Awa_Nikolas_A

[MidLeft][LoadAwa]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
Ahaha! Tell me, Awa, have you noticed[N]
anything[Beat] different about us lately?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your smile is, somehow, brighter.[N]
I hate it. Is it because of the horse?[A]
[MidRight]
Gasp! Shock and horror! Awa, he is not[N]
[OpenQuote]the horse!" This steed has a name, now![A]
[MidLeft]
I had a feeling that would be it. Okay,[N]
spill it; what's this one's name, then?[A]
[MidRight]
Nikolas![A]
[MidLeft]
No, not you. I meant the horse.[A]
[MidRight]
Gasp! I thought I told you not to call[N]
him [OpenQuote]the horse" like that! How rude![A]
[MidLeft]
Please stop saying "gasp" like that[Beat][AN]
And, are you telling me you named[N]
your own horse after yourself?[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! I was once told I lived a most[N]
admirably, blissfully ignorant life![AN]
And you told me I should name him after[N]
somebody I admire! It just makes sense![A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] have to respect the confidence.[AN]
But aren't you worried about sharing[N]
a name being sort of[Beat] confusing?[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, Awa, surely you know by now that[N]
I would be confused regardless![A]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] shockingly self-aware of you.[AN]
You sort of come across as perpetually[N]
baffled. It's quite charming, really.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes! It's true! Like today, I am baffled[N]
by yet another horse question![A]
[MidLeft]
Oh? This sounds like it'll be fun;[N]
What's today's horse question?[A]
[MidRight]
Your friend[Beat] he is wingless! Why?[N]
When will Puru hatch his adult wings?[AN]
And are you sure it's moral to bring a[N]
child horse along to the battlefield!?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] I changed my mind. Not fun enough.[N]
I'll talk to you later, Nikolas.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Yes! I will also talk to you later![AN]
Or[Beat] wait[Beat] was she talking to you,[N]
Nikolas? My god, so I was right[Beat][AN]
She DOES speak Horsese after all[Beat][A][X]
