Hey, lady. Mind telling me why every[N]
time I look this way, you're giving me[N]
this nasty scowl? What's the deal?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm not scowling at you, I'm simply[N]
scowling while looking at you.[A]
[MidRight]
And the reason you're watching[N]
me so closely is because[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft]
Because every time I look YOUR way,[N]
YOU are scowling at ME. That's why.[A]
[MidRight]
Is that right? You gonna give me a[N]
lecture like the other holy types?[AN]
You got a problem with my [OpenQuote]attitude?"[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Lemme tell you something; I've been[N]
fighting for the liberation since I[N]
was a little kid, you understand?[AN]
I was liberation before there even[N]
WAS a liberation. I've been killing[N]
Cytheans since they first invaded.[AN]
And I've had enough of you and your[N]
[OpenQuote]godly" peers coming into my war,[AN]
judging my conduct as [OpenQuote]too churlish"[N]
just because I'm not some story book[N]
knight like your mommies told you about.[AN]
You wanna judge the way I carry myself?[AN]
Pick up a sword for a few years, and if[N]
you're still alive, then we can talk.[A]
[MidLeft]
If you think I'm going to be intimidated[N]
by a no-name mercenary with a chip on[N]
her shoulder, you're sorely mistaken.[AN]
I don't care how much Cythean chaff[N]
you've cut through, I won't stand for[N]
some vulgar clod to disrespect the cloth![AN]
Now you can take your uncouth self the[N]
hell out of my sight, or I'll take this[N]
here staff and shove it up your-[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Hahah! That's what I'm talking about![A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I-I[Beat] uh[Beat] what?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
No no, don't stop there! You were[N]
just about to get all fired up![AN]
We were so close to having an actually[N]
fun conversation! Do you have any[N]
idea how rare those are in this army?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
You[Beat] find this fun? Are you[N]
trying to mock me?[A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
No, not at all! Man, I really spoiled[N]
it, huh? Ah well, maybe next time, eh?[AN]
Look, the name's Awa; swing on by if[N]
you're ever feeling bored, y'hear?[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
What[Beat]? I[Beat] That little[Beat]![N]
she's ABSOLUTELY mocking me![AN]
If I see her again, I'm gonna[N]
give her a piece of my mind![A][X]

Oooh, it's you again![AN]
How's my best bud holding up today?[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Can it. What's with this act you're[N]
putting on? Do you think you're funny?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
What? No, not at all! I'm just glad[N]
somebody in this pack of losers has[N]
some real honest fire in their belly.[AN]
So many proud heroes and noble knights[N]
and learned men and pious priests. Yawn![AN]
What fun is there in chatting about[Beat][N]
I dunno, logistics and scripture and[N]
junk when you could just let loose![AN]
You know what I mean, don't you?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
No! Not at all! You're saying you find[N]
arguing[Beat] fun? This is fun to you?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Hell yeah I do! Why, you don't?[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Not even a little bit![A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Awesome, let's argue about it![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
No, I don't- would you cut it out!?[AN]
I don't want to be your [OpenQuote]best bud!"[AN]
Last time we spoke, you flung all manner[N]
of insults at me, at my faith, at my[N]
profession[Beat] and now you[Beat] you[Beat]![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Yeah yeah, you're mad, right?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Oh, I'm absolutely fuming! I'm[Beat] I'm[N]
downright steaming, that's how mad I am![A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Don't you just wanna give me a piece[N]
of your mind right about now!?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
I do! And[Beat] and I will! You[Beat][N]
you're just a pig-headed, ignorant,[N]
brutish[Beat] uh[Beat] what's the word?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Stubborn?[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
No, but that too! Stubborn like a mule![A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Or an ox![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Yes, yes, like an ox! Thank you![AN]
Oh, and you're intractable! That's[N]
right, you're obstinate! Obdurate![N]
Completely recalcitrant, even![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Okay, you lost me a bit, but I love[N]
the energy you've got going here.[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Thanks! I-I mean, how dare you! This[N]
isn't a game, I'm[Beat] I'm furious![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, yeah, me too! My turn?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Absolutely![A] Wait wait, one more thing.[AN]
You're boorish, too! You're a boor![A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oooh, I like that one. Pretty good[Beat][N]
for a stuck up brat like yourself![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Oh, you did not call me stuck up![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
But I totally did. You're a stuck up,[N]
pampered, self-righteous, snooty[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadDelilah]
Oh, Awa! I've been looking all over[N]
for you! I brought you something![A]
[MidRight]
Oh yeah? What's this then, some[N]
kinda[Beat] oh come on, is this scripture?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, of course not, I know you couldn't[N]
care less about the faith. Look![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
A[Beat] thesaurus.[A] What?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Last time we talked, we had to stop[N]
when we ran out of insults, right?[AN]
I figured it would only be prudent to[N]
brush up on our skills for next time.[A]
[MidRight]
Wow, you're really serious about this.[AN]
Hmm[Beat] though, it does seem pretty[N]
useful, actually. Let's see here[Beat][AN]
Oh, so THAT's what obdurate means!?[A]
[MidLeft]
This way, we can keep going for as long[N]
as there are words left to spare![AN]
Oh, perhaps we could even make new ones?[N]
I could bring some parchment, and[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Awa? Are you alright?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[OpenEyes]O-oh, yeah, I'm fine. Just[Beat] man, I[N]
don't know, I guess I'm touched, is all.[AN]
Most people don't really get it, but[N]
you've gone all above and beyond, and[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
It really wasn't that much of a bother.[N]
Like you said before, it's fun![AN]
It's so exhilarating to just cut loose[N]
like that. I've been told I'm quite[Beat][AN]
direct, shall we say, in my demeanour,[N]
but never before have I met somebody[N]
who actually likes that about me![A]
[MidRight]
And you're the first person to really[N]
be fun to trade jabs with since[Beat][AN]
e-ever, actually! Never ever![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Liar. Who was it? They sound[N]
mysterious. A secret ex lover?[AN]
Maybe a dark mercenary rival?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
No, nothing like that. Just[Beat] before[N]
Cythes invaded, my brother and I would[N]
argue for fun all the time. But, well[Beat][AN]
I'd hardly be the first Decian with a[N]
few dead family members behind me, huh?[AN]
It's no big deal, really.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, Awa[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
A-anyway, uh[Beat] how about that book![N]
I've got all sorts of inspiration now.[AN]
Who knew that on top of being a milksop[N]
and a haughty priss, you were also a[Beat][AN]
[OpenQuote]vainglorious[Beat] supercilious[Beat][N]
acquiescent[Beat] blowhard." Wow.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Hah, maybe we can save the thesaurus for[N]
a rainy day. Wouldn't want your[Beat][AN]
uh, hand me that thing for a second[Beat][AN]
your [OpenQuote]bumptious foozling" to get the[N]
pages all messed up, am I right?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Pfft, I'm bumptious now, am I? Alright,[N]
listen here, you pompous little hag,[AN]
there's not a chance in hell I'm letting[N]
you get away with that one, you hear me?[A]

As if an ignoramus like you could ever[N]
get under my skin. Do your worst![A][X]

[MidLeft]
Oho, Delilah![N]
I've finally found you![AN]
[MidRight]
[OpenQuote]Finally?" What reason would you have[N]
to be looking for me for that long?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Are we not both allies in our faith,[N]
adherents to Byelen's words and deeds?[AN]
I was heartened to hear of another[N]
like-minded soul in our army,[N]
and so, I have sought you out.[AN]
[MidRight]
Right[Beat] Look, I don't think[N]
we're all that similar, lady.[AN]
The differences between the Decian[N]
faithful and the Mahemen church[N]
are as wide as the Decian Sea.[AN]
[MidLeft]
True, I have heard that Byelen's[N]
followers in Decia are regrettably[N]
cowards in their appetite for war.[AN]
I suppose I can't blame them,[N]
given the feelings of the first[N]
founder of Decian Byelenism.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And what exactly do you mean by that?[N]
Is it not natural to want peace?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course it is, but the founder was[N]
a fool who rolled over and accepted[N]
an unjust peace over a righteous war.[AN]
He let his own desires interfere[N]
with the true scriptures of Byelenism,[N]
substituting it with their own beliefs.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Sorry, but I'm not interested in a[N]
history lesson. See you around, or not.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The girl's got a sharp tongue on her[Beat][AN]
I thought being in this army meant she[N]
thought differently from her peers,[N]
but apparently not. Why is she here?[AN]
[Beat]Well, I can ask her another time.[N]
Our opponents are in need of smiting![AN][X]

## DelilahIlseBSupport
[MidLeft][LoadIlse]
[MidRight][LoadDelilah]
Ugh, not you again[Beat] Did you[N]
come back for another lecture?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, not exactly. I thought over your[N]
words and found myself curious about[N]
what teachings you learned in particular.[AN]
Although I admittedly have little regard[N]
for them, perhaps I am simply biased[N]
and would benefit from hearing more.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Really? Well, if you insist.[AN]
The founder you spoke of, Murrai,[N]
taught us the horrors of bloodshed,[N]
using examples from Byelen's texts.[AN]
For example, the Massacre of Hayanth,[N]
where Mahemeni paladins of Byelen fell[N]
in droves at the hands of Cherne's cult.[AN]
The Book of Byelen discusses it in[N]
great length, often spending pages[N]
to describe the agony of our priests.[AN]
Murrai interpreted this as a sorrowful[N]
situation, one which shows the horrors[N]
of war, and so too do Decian believers.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I can certainly understand that stance,[N]
but it illustrates Murrai's liberties[N]
taken in intepreting the holy book.[AN]
The Church of Byelen takes the same[N]
situation but preaches an entirely[N]
different learning lesson instead.[AN]
The paladins of Hayanth were no doubt[N]
noble, but they were also complacent.[AN]
They knew of the Chernian heretics[N]
long before they became a threat,[N]
but they chose to allow their existence.[AN]
This error led to their downfall, where[N]
if they had only fought, they'd survive.[AN]
[MidRight]
[OpenQuote]Allow their existence" is a funny way[N]
of saying [OpenQuote]segregate them from Hayanth."[AN]
The paladins forced them to live in the[N]
outskirts and harassed any followers of[N]
Cherne that openly showed their beliefs.[AN]
Had Cherne's followers been allowed to[N]
exist in harmony with Byelen's, who can[N]
say the massacre would've ever happened?[AN]
The Church of Byelen's embrace of war[N]
is just a cover for their past misdeeds,[N]
which Murrai understood and abhorred.[AN]
That's why he left in the first place![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hmph, who can say, indeed. None of[N]
us know where Byelen's fate may lead us.[AN]
Murrai lived in a time where Mahemen[N]
was much less stable, where the king[N]
changed as often as the desert wind.[AN]
I cannot agree with accepting Cherne[N]
or His cultists, but[Beat] Murrai was[N]
not entirely off in his arguments.[AN]
Thank you, Delilah. This discussion[N]
was as fruitful as I had imagined.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, uh[Beat] thanks? I was just[N]
speaking my mind, that's all.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That inclination is more valuable than[N]
you know. I have long thought that the[N]
Church of Byelen is far too inflexible,[AN]
so seeing a young adherent like yourself[N]
fills me with optimism and joy.[AN]
Ah, but we have a battle to attend to![N]
My apologies for the distraction.[AN]

Hey, you! I have a question.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You? Isn't that a bit rude of a way[N]
to refer to an ally and friend?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I don't recall you being my friend[Beat][N]
Anyway, you never told me your name,[N]
so I don't know what else to call you.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I didn't? Well, that's embarrassing.[N]
I am Ilse. What did you want to ask?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, right. I was wondering[Beat] Why me?[AN]
There are certainly[Beat] less caustic[N]
people like us in this army.[N]
Why bother speaking to me instead?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Let me answer that question with[N]
a question. You speak fondly of Murrai's[N]
principles, and yet, you stand with us.[AN]
I'd heard of your penchant for peace,[N]
and so, I wondered. Why fight such[N]
bloody battles if those are your ideals?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat] that's a bit of a long story.[AN]
It started with me being freed from[N]
a prison cell by the Liberators,[N]
but so many things have changed.[AN]
I've thought about packing my bags[N]
and heading back to Decia, saving[N]
my own skin[Beat] but I can't do it.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
And why is that?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm not really sure myself.[N]
Is this what camaraderie feels like?[N]
[Beat]What a terrible feeling.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mm[Beat] That contradiction is why I was[N]
interested in you. The juxtaposition from[N]
a desire for peace and a need for war[Beat][AN]
You don't often see it in the faithful.[N]
Most adhere strongly to their own dogma,[N]
leaving no room for doubt in their heart.[AN]
For many years, I too thought this way,[N]
but encountering you, and the Liberators,[N]
stirred old thoughts I had long buried.[AN]
Perhaps Murrai was incorrect[Beat][N]
but so too were Mahemen's saints,[N]
and in their day, moreso than him.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'm[Beat] glad, to be of help,[N]
I guess. Still, where are you[N]
going with all this talk?[AN]
No matter what you may think,[N]
it doesn't change the state[N]
of Byelenism and its many flaws.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
True. That is why I intend to reform it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh[Beat] what?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Now, I can see that the state of[N]
the church is simply untenable.[AN]
When all this is over, I intend to[N]
get to work and change people's[N]
views on what Byelenism should be.[AN]
Something less focused on exacting[N]
control over the citizenry via faith,[N]
and more about one's own principles.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That[Beat] sounds nice and all,[N]
but can you really do it?[AN]
It's not a small task to[N]
challenge the archbishops.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Who knows? Better to try than to not,[N]
and with enough supporters, anything[N]
can happen. I trust I have one in you?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Does that mean what I think it means?[N]
No way, I'm not getting involved[N]
in something that dangerous![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Too bad, I won't take no for an answer.[N]
Welcome aboard, Delilah![A]
