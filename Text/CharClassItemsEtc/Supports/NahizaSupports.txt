Well, howdy there, Hornet! Fancy[N]
seeing you out here, ain't it?[A]
[MidLeft]
You mean the battlefield in the[N]
war we're supposed to be fighting?[A]
[MidRight]
Yup! That's the place! Gosh, I[N]
gotta tell you, man; you shoot,[AN]
like, really reeeeally reeeeeeeally far.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I know. You[Beat] also[Beat] shoot far.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Right!? It's like my thing, you know?[AN]
I'm the shoots-far lady, but YOU'RE[N]
the shoots-far-fastlike lady![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Okay.[A]
[MidRight]
Soooooo? You gonna fess up?[A]
[MidLeft]
Fess what up?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Your tricks! Your secrets! C'mon,[N]
spill the beans! I reckon you got[N]
all kinds of special techniques.[AN]
Is it magic? You hiding a secret[N]
identical twin to help shoot?[AN]
Oh my god, you're not engaging in[N]
recreational vulnerary use, are you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What. Are you talking about.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Looky here partner, I know when[N]
something's fishy. I smell it, y'hear?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Are you saying I smell like fish?[A]
[MidRight]
Wh-what? No, of course not-![A]
[MidLeft]
Whatever. I'm out of here.[A][ClearFace]

Hornet! Heyyy, Hornet! Hey partner![A]
[MidLeft]
By Byelen, she's found me. It's all over.[A]
[MidRight]
Howdy-how-ya-doin, sis?[A]
[MidLeft]
Worse, now that I've heard that.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Awww, whaaat? It's an old family greeting![N]
Y' can't hate on family greetings![AN]
Huge faux pas, lady. Mighty uncouth of ya.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Why don't any of the other Mahemeni[N]
talk like you, anyway? Is it some kind[N]
of practical joke at my expense?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Regional dialect. Say, I was thinking-[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh no, not thinking.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Whaddya say you and I have[N]
ourselves a good ol' fashioned[N]
arch-off! Reckon it'd be fuuuun![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
An[Beat] arch-off?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah! Me, you, and a few dozen[Beat][N]
hundred[Beat] thousand target dummies![AN]
Nothing to do but shoot arrows[N]
in fierce competition! For days![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Days!? That'd take weeks![A]
[MidRight]
Even better! Yeehaw![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yee-hell-no! We're fighting a war,[N]
remember? A real, actual, live war?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
All the more reason to live a lil'![AN]
All that doom and gloom, yeuch![N]
Baaad for the hair, I tell ya. Look;[AN]
You and I, we're evenly matched,[N]
I reckon. There's only one way[N]
to settle this in my book.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Settle what? And why?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Who's the better shot, and[Beat][AN]
y'know[Beat] cuz! C'mooooon, can't[N]
you read the writing on the wall, here?[AN]
I ain't leaving 'til I get my contest.[A]
[MidLeft]
What, is this really up for debate?[AN]
I've been training all my life to use[N]
a bow. I mastered using it on foot,[AN]
then on horseback, then while moving.[N]
I'm a crackshot, a downright prodigy.[AN]
You're a girl from the sticks, playing[N]
with some gearhead's fancy toy.[AN]
Face it, Nahiza;[N]
We are not the same.[A]
[MidRight]
Whaaaaat!? You even had a fancypants[N]
villain speech prepared? This rules![AN]
Oh man, my very first heel![A]
[MidLeft]
I didn't have anything prepared![AN]
I'm serious! I think you're weird![N]
And annoying! And scrawny![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Woah woah woah, hold up just one[N]
gosh darn minute on that one, Hornet.[AN]
Weird, I'll give you that one.[N]
Annoying, eh, to each their own.[AN]
But scrawny? No way, partner.[AN]
I reckon I'm buff as heck! Heck,[N]
I reckon I'm buff as hell! Hell,[N]
I reckon I'm buff as f-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I get the picture.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] So do I. Don't wanna get shown up, huh?[AN]
Scared of finding out this scrawn[N]
is secretly hiding tons of brawn, eh?[AN]
You're just a scared lil' fella, ain'tcha?[N]
Scared! Chicken![A]
[MidLeft]
I'm leaving before you break my focus[N]
any further than you already have.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah, you better run, you coward![N]
Better hope I don't catch you![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
How could you? I'm on horseback![A]
[MidRight]
I KNOW, it SUCKS![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadHornet]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Nahiza.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
H-Hornet! Wow, usually I'm the one[N]
who threateningly corners you, huh?[AN]
What's the occasion?[A]
[MidLeft]
What is it, really, that you want from me?[AN]
The archery competition, your interrogations,[N]
even how you constantly hang around me.[AN]
You're trying to get something out of me.[A]
[MidRight]
What? No, no! Nothing like that, I swear![N]
You and I are just, like[Beat] partner rivals![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Partner rivals?[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah! You know, like frenemies kinda.[A]
[MidLeft]
I understand less now.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Look, Hornet: I respect you, y'hear?[N]
You're skilled, composed, stoic[Beat][AN]
You're cool in all the ways I'm not![AN]
So I thought maybe if I hung around[N]
you, I could learn to BE like you![AN]
But you[Beat] don't seem to like me very much.[AN]
While you zip around the battlefield,[N]
I'm just stuck back at the rear, like[Beat][AN]
Dead weight, I guess. Makes me[N]
feel like I'm not contributing enough.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] so you want to be more like me?[N]
Nahiza, remember last time we spoke?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yup! I reckon I'll never forget it.[A]
[MidLeft]
Uh[Beat] huh. Well, remember what I called you?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You[Beat] called me weird, annoying,[N]
scrawny, weak, pathetic, freakish,[N]
malformed, duplicitous-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I think you're making most of that up.[A]
[MidRight]
Nuh-uh! Plus I wasn't even done![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Look, you may be[Beat] some of those things.[N]
(The ones I actually said, mostly[Beat])[AN]
But this army NEEDS a weird, annoying,[N]
scrawny ballistician. It needs a Nahiza,[AN]
more than it could ever need another[N]
Hornet. So[Beat] don't worry about it.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But I can't not stop don't worrying![N]
Or something! You can do so many[N]
things that I can't, I reckon I'll nev-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
(Mumble mumble)[A]
[MidRight]
Uh, what was that?[A]
[MidLeft]
I'm[Beat] also[Beat] (mumble mumble)[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hornet, you just keep whispering mumble[N]
mumble. What are you trying to say?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I-I said I also get jealous sometimes![AN]
You can shoot so much further, and your[N]
ballista is[Beat] c-cool! And you, Nahiza[Beat][AN]
You're just so you about everything.[N]
You just blurt out whatever you feel[N]
with no shame. It must be so freeing.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] Huh. I ain't ever been complimented[N]
like that before. I thought you hated me![A]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] there's worse things to be than[N]
weird and annoying, so I guess[Beat][AN]
I don't particularly mind you being here.[A]
[MidRight]
Wow! That's the nicest thing you've[N]
ever said to me, Hornet! Ever![A]
[MidLeft]
Heh, yeah, I'm actually super nice.[AN]
Say, what if you taught me how to use[N]
that ballista of yours some time?[AN]
I can teach you to ride my horse![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yeah! I reckon that's a fine idea.[A][X]

## NahizaRashidC
[MidLeft][LoadRashid][MidRight][LoadNahiza]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, pardner.[A][N]
Whenever I drag my ballista[N]
near ya, there's somethin'[N]
real odd that happens to it.[A][N]
The bolts fly truer than[N]
they ever have before.[A][N]
You reckon you know[N]
what's up with that?[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my ability to spur hit.[A][N]
I was able to do that even[N]
when I was still alive.[A][N]
It's just a few tricks that[N]
I've picked up and honed[N]
across many battlefields.[A][N]
I dart in and out like a[N]
snake, giving my friends[N]
advice and guiding their aim.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, that's nice and all,[N]
but it ain't quite[N]
what's happening to me.[A][N]
You're not saying a single[N]
darn word, and my aim's[N]
getting better anyway.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Then in that case,[N]
I really don't know.[A][N]
I'm sorry I couldn't[N]
be of more help, miss.[A]
[MidRight]
What, you think I'd be mad about[N]
being better at landin' my shots?[A][N]
That's nonsense.[A][N]
[Beat]And I'm not a [OpenQuote]miss", pardner.[N]
I'm actually married, y'know.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I see-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I doubt you can see a darn[N]
thing through that helmet.[A][N]
Stay close, though.[N]
I'll be needin' that[N]
extra accuracy you give.[A]
[MidRight]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What just happened?[A][X]


## NahizaRashidB

[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hold on. Nahiza,[N]
your name is, right?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Sure is, pardner.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Alright. It's just[Beat][A][N]
back when you asked me[N]
about my ability to spur hit,[N]
you said you were married.[A][N]
That just[Beat] doesn't strike me[N]
as like you, from what I know.[A]
[MidRight]
Looks can be decievin'.[A][N]
For one, you're a lot more[N]
talkative than I would[N]
reckon most ghosts are.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's fair.[A][N]
[Beat]So what is your family like?[A]
[MidRight]
They're why I'm a soldier, really.[A][N]
Truth be told, I've always[N]
reckoned I want to be a florist,[A][N]
growin' big bouquets of[N]
wisterias and whatnot.[A][N]
But in times like these, that[N]
doesn't keep my family safe,[A][N]
and that definitely doesn't[N]
pay the bills for us either.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sacrificing your passions[N]
to help your family[Beat][A][N]
They must be proud to[N]
have a wife like you.[A]
[MidRight]
They sure are.[N]
How about you, pardner?[A][N]
Got any family or such?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]If I did,[N]
they're all long dead.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, heck.[N]
That got dark fast.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Sorry about that.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, it's[Beat] fine.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad to hear that[N]
no matter what era it is,[A][N]
people always do their best[N]
to protect those they love.[A][X]


## NahizaRashidA
[MidLeft][LoadRashid][MidRight][LoadNahiza]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Howdy.[A][N]
Now then, Rashid, we had[N]
a very nice chat last[N]
time 'bout my family,[A][N]
but you never did explain[N]
how it is you helped me aim.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm not quite sure of[N]
that myself, to be honest.[A][N]
Maybe we can test it[N]
somehow to figure it out.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[FarFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
First, try firing[N]
when I'm over here[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][LoadRashid]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
And again when I'm here.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, wow.[N]
That difference's big as heck.[A][N]
See how it doesn't wobble[N]
as much in the air?[A]
[MidLeft]
I sure do.[AN]
That's[Beat] maybe your additional[N]
accuracy comes from morale?[A]
[MidRight]
I don't even know what[N]
that word means, pardner.[A]
[MidLeft]
Morale is how good you're[N]
feeling about the fight.[A][N]
When a friend like me[N]
stands somewhere near you,[A][N]
you feel better and fight[N]
better because of it.[A]
[MidRight]
Huh. Neat. One of the[N]
world's mysteries, I guess.[A][N]
And when you're actually[N]
doing the advice thing,[A][N]
where'd you learn that?[A]
[MidLeft]
My brother wanted to[N]
learn the bow like me,[A][N]
so I went to my boss[N]
and asked for some help.[A][N]
The commander gave me some tips,[N]
I started teaching my brother,[A][N]
and then I just kept[N]
giving him lessons in battle.[A][N]
Other soldiers started asking[N]
me for that help, too,[A][N]
and it just kinda[N]
continued from there.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Y'know, my husband's actually[N]
workin' as a schoolteacher,[A][N]
back in the Holy City Telyada.[A][N]
With how effective your whole[N]
hit-spurring thingamabob is,[A][N]
I reckon he could learn an awful[N]
lot from your teaching style.[A][N]
Maybe I'll introduce ya once[N]
this whole war thing's over.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
After this conflict ends,[N]
I won't have many[N]
other places to go[Beat][A][N]
I'd be glad to help[N]
with that, Nahiza.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Stamina drink? What?[A][N]
All I know is it's the best[N]
*hic* thing I've ever drunk![A][N]
Way better than the typical flavored[N]
water that Chouwouj bars serve.[A][N]
And Taraji hates *hic* havin'[N]
her soldiers not stay sober.[A]
