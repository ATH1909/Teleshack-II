Hey, pardner.[A][N]
Whenever I drag my ballista[N]
near ya, there's somethin'[N]
real odd that happens to it.[A][N]
The bolts fly truer than[N]
they ever have before.[A][N]
You reckon you know[N]
what's up with that?[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my ability to spur hit.[A][N]
I was able to do that even[N]
when I was still alive.[A][N]
It's just a few tricks that[N]
I've picked up and honed[N]
across many battlefields.[A][N]
I dart in and out like a[N]
snake, giving my friends[N]
advice and guiding their aim.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, that's nice and all,[N]
but it ain't quite[N]
what's happening to me.[A][N]
You're not saying a single[N]
darn word, and my aim's[N]
getting better anyway.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Then in that case,[N]
I really don't know.[A][N]
I'm sorry I couldn't[N]
be of more help, miss.[A]
[MidRight]
What, you think I'd be mad about[N]
being better at landin' my shots?[A][N]
That's nonsense.[A][N]
[Beat]And I'm not a [OpenQuote]miss", pardner.[N]
I'm actually married, y'know.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I see-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I doubt you can see a darn[N]
thing through that helmet.[A][N]
Stay close, though.[N]
I'll be needin' that[N]
extra accuracy you give.[A]
[MidRight]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What just happened?[A][X]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hold on. Nahiza,[N]
your name is, right?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Sure is, pardner.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Alright. It's just[Beat][A][N]
back when you asked me[N]
about my ability to spur hit,[N]
you said you were married.[A][N]
That just[Beat] doesn't strike me[N]
as like you, from what I know.[A]
[MidRight]
Looks can be decievin'.[A][N]
For one, you're a lot more[N]
talkative than I would[N]
reckon most ghosts are.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's fair.[A][N]
[Beat]So what is your family like?[A]
[MidRight]
They're why I'm a soldier, really.[A][N]
Truth be told, I've always[N]
reckoned I want to be a florist,[A][N]
growin' big bouquets of[N]
wisterias and whatnot.[A][N]
But in times like these, that[N]
doesn't keep my family safe,[A][N]
and that definitely doesn't[N]
pay the bills for us either.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sacrificing your passions[N]
to help your family[Beat][A][N]
They must be proud to[N]
have a wife like you.[A]
[MidRight]
They sure are.[N]
How about you, pardner?[A][N]
Got any family or such?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]If I did,[N]
they're all long dead.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, heck.[N]
That got dark fast.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Sorry about that.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, it's[Beat] fine.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad to hear that[N]
no matter what era it is,[A][N]
people always do their best[N]
to protect those they love.[A][X]

Howdy.[A][N]
Now then, Rashid, we had[N]
a very nice chat last[N]
time 'bout my family,[A][N]
but you never did explain[N]
how it is you helped me aim.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm not quite sure of[N]
that myself, to be honest.[A][N]
Maybe we can test it[N]
somehow to figure it out.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[FarFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
First, try firing[N]
when I'm over here[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][LoadRashid]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
And again when I'm here.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, wow.[N]
That difference's big as heck.[A][N]
See how it doesn't wobble[N]
as much in the air?[A]
[MidLeft]
I sure do.[AN]
That's[Beat] maybe your additional[N]
accuracy comes from morale?[A]
[MidRight]
I don't even know what[N]
that word means, pardner.[A]
[MidLeft]
Morale is how good you're[N]
feeling about the fight.[A][N]
When a friend like me[N]
stands somewhere near you,[A][N]
you feel better and fight[N]
better because of it.[A]
[MidRight]
Huh. Neat. One of the[N]
world's mysteries, I guess.[A][N]
And when you're actually[N]
doing the advice thing,[A][N]
where'd you learn that?[A]
[MidLeft]
My brother wanted to[N]
learn the bow like me,[A][N]
so I went to my boss[N]
and asked for some help.[A][N]
The commander gave me some tips,[N]
I started teaching my brother,[A][N]
and then I just kept[N]
giving him lessons in battle.[A][N]
Other soldiers started asking[N]
me for that help, too,[A][N]
and it just kinda[N]
continued from there.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Y'know, my husband's actually[N]
workin' as a schoolteacher,[A][N]
back in the Holy City Telyada.[A][N]
With how effective your whole[N]
hit-spurring thingamabob is,[A][N]
I reckon he could learn an awful[N]
lot from your teaching style.[A][N]
Maybe I'll introduce ya once[N]
this whole war thing's over.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
After this conflict ends,[N]
I won't have many[N]
other places to go[Beat][A][N]
I'd be glad to help[N]
with that, Nahiza.[A][X]

Hey, pardner, got any idea[N]
where my special flask went?[A]
[MidLeft]
Wha? Whuh?[A][N]
I don't got the faintest[N]
idea what yer talkin' about.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Nah, I can see it right[N]
in your hand there.[A][N]
That's my stamina drink you're[N]
drinkin', is what it is.[A]
[MidLeft]
Stamina drink? What?[A][N]
All I know is it's the best[N]
*hic* thing I've ever drunk![A][N]
Way better than the typical flavored[N]
water that Chouwouj bars serve.[A][N]
And Taraji hates *hic* havin'[N]
her soldiers not stay sober.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, that makes sense.[A][N]
I feel you there. The Sacred[N]
Arrows were almost as bad.[A][N]
What's your name, pardner?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
*hic* Jerry. How 'bout you?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Nahiza, best ballistician[N]
in this here army.[A][N]
Also the only ballistician, I think.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Glad to meet you.[A][N]
There's this old bar over in[N]
the *hic* Himbasha Mountains[N]
that hasn't banned me yet.[A][N]
They've got some damn fine mead.[A][N]
Care to give that a *hic*[N]
try one of these days?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]That'd be lovely, pardner.[A][X]

So now that we're *hic*[N]
over in Cythes, you[N]
know any good bars here?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I ain't never been[N]
to Cythes before now.[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh.[A] Neither have I, actually.[A][N]
Not sure why I *hic* asked.[A][N]
[Beat]Maybe we should try *hic*[N]
askin' some locals or somesuch.[A]
[MidRight]
Eh, that sounds like[N]
an awful lotta effort[A][N]
when we just want to try[N]
out the local beer.[A][N]
Say, that building over there[N]
looks like a real good saloon.[A][N]
You wanna head in once[N]
this fight's wrapped up?[A]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]*hic* Heck yeah![A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, look, there's *hic* an[N]
enemy coming this way.[A][N]
Lemme go *hic* fight 'em.[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Hey, did you drop something?[A]
[MidLeft][LoadJerry]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh, yeah, that![N]
Thanks, *hic* chief.[A]
[MidLeft]

Hey, Jerry.[A]
[MidLeft]
What's *hic* up?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Y'know, you never did give me[N]
back that there stamina drink.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Drat.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Wouldja please hand it over?[A]
[MidLeft]
Can't, sorry. I already[N]
*hic* drank it all up.[A][N]
I guess if you want[N]
the *hic* empty bottle?[A]
[MidRight]
Why, you[Beat]![A][N]
That stamina drink was[N]
a special family recipe![A]
[MidLeft]
Can they not *hic* make more[N]
or somethin'?[A] [CloseEyes]Are they dead?[A][OpenEyes]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Nah, they're doin'[N]
just fine in Telyada.[A][N]
Just that I can't exactly[N]
go back and get more,[A][N]
what with us runnin'[N]
around in Cythes and[N]
killing a god and all.[A][N]
And that stamina drink[N]
was extra special.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I guess I'm *hic* sorry?[A]
[MidRight]
We both know you're not.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, I'm not.[A][N]
What if *hic* I tell you 'bout[N]
my favorite *hic* drink in return?[A]
