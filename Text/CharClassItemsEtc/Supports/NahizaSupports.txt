Hey, pardner, got any idea[N]
where my special flask went?[A]
[MidLeft]
Wha? Whuh?[A][N]
I don't got the faintest[N]
idea what yer talkin' about.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Nah, I can see it right[N]
in your hand there.[A][N]
That's my stamina drink you're[N]
drinkin', is what it is.[A]
[MidLeft]
Stamina drink? What?[A][N]
All I know is it's the best[N]
*hic* thing I've ever drunk![A][N]
Way better than the typical flavored[N]
water that Chouwouj bars serve.[A][N]
And Taraji hates *hic* havin'[N]
her soldiers not stay sober.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, that makes sense.[A][N]
I feel you there. The Sacred[N]
Arrows were almost as bad.[A][N]
What's your name, pardner?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
*hic* Jerry. How 'bout you?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Nahiza, best ballistician[N]
in this here army.[A][N]
Also the only ballistician, I think.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Glad to meet you.[A][N]
There's this old bar over in[N]
the *hic* Himbasha Mountains[N]
that hasn't banned me yet.[A][N]
They've got some damn fine mead.[A][N]
Care to give that a *hic*[N]
try one of these days?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]That'd be lovely, pardner.[A][X]

[MidLeft]

Not sure why I *hic* asked.[A][N]
[Beat]Maybe we should try *hic*[N]
askin' some locals or somesuch.[A]
[MidRight]
Eh, that sounds like[N]
an awful lotta effort[A][N]
when we just want to try[N]
out the local beer.[A][N]
Say, that building over there[N]
looks like a real good saloon.[A][N]
You wanna head in once[N]

or somethin'?[A] [CloseEyes]Are they dead?[A][OpenEyes]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
