[MidRight]
Excuse me, Kwame, but I must know,[N]
what is the book you have in your satchel?[A]
[MidLeft]
I was taught it was nosy to ask[N]
others about their possessions.[A]
[MidRight]
Ah, forgive me.[N]
I am a researcher by trade.[AN]
Specifcally interested in the history[N]
of Orodreth and the world at large[Beat][AN]
I suppose nosing where I don't[N]
necessarily belong is a skill of mine.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's not a very becoming trait, you know.[N]
I'm not a musty tome in a lost tomb,[N]
waiting for someone to dust me off.[AN]
I'd prefer to keep my privacy about the[N]
things that I read in my free time.[N]
I trust you can understand this.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm, yes, I can respect your privacy.[N]
I apologize for prying.[A][X]

## Kofi_Kwame_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame, I need to ask you[Beat][N]
You know quite a lot of many things,[N]
especially of things long ago, correct?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Why do you ask, Kofi?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm trying to piece together a few[N]
things that were seemingly ommitted[N]
from the Book of Havarti.[AN]
As a scholar and a researcher with an[N]
interest in the Reclamation Wars,[N]
there are few topics more critical.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I can say I know a few things[N]
about the Reclamation Wars, yes.[AN]
Is there something you'd like to know?[N]
Perhaps I could be of use to you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
The Book of Havarti focuses most heavily[N]
on the role of Byelen, the divination[N]
of the weapons, and Abalone IX's fall.[AN]
There are only whispers of another figure[N]
who appears throughout multiple texts,[N]
but seldom is the star of any text.[AN]
While I suspect some ommissions are cultural,[N]
due to the strong political grip of[N]
the Byelen faithful,[AN]
I cannot help but want to better understand[N]
the supposed God of Knowledge, Cherne,[N]
for their impact is felt today, even still.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] In what way?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Is the magic you wield not that[N]
which Cherne brought to the world?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, that much is true.[N]
Followers of Cherne,[AN]
obscure as they may be on the continent,[N]
prefer the use of elder magics, let's say.[AN]
Your observation is astute.[N]
Havarti himself knew little of Cherne,[AN]
and the records of the Reclamation Wars[N]
say little of Cherne's involvement.[A]
[MidRight]
It's a shame[Beat][AN]
The proliferation of Byelen's faithful[N]
have stymied the understanding of truth.[AN]
That's not to say I think Byelen[N]
is a foul deity, not in the slightest,[AN]
but suppressing opposing views limits our[N]
understanding of the world,[AN]
and of our ability to ensure we do not[N]
make the same mistakes of history.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hmm[Beat] Indeed.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I know I've likely been annoying you,[N]
prying into your affairs, Kwame.[AN]
Thank you for entertaining me.[N]
You've given me much to consider.[A]
[MidLeft]
To say I did something would be bombastic,[N]
for in truth, it was nothing at all.[A]
[MidRight]
It's appreciated nonetheless.[N]
We'll speak soon, I'm sure.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
He reminds me of someone.[N]
It makes me wonder[Beat][A][X]

## Kofi_Kwame_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
[MidLeft]
Kofi. It is now my turn to[N]
ask you a question.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame?[N]
Yes, of course, what is it?[A]
[MidLeft]
How did you come to study history?[N]
How did it become your passion?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I was born in Chouwouj.[N]
My mother was a magic researcher[N]
under the employ of Lord Dikembe.[AN]
[Beat] I never knew my father.[N]
I grew up around books and tomes, and[N]
she instilled in me a love for the unknown.[AN]
Although life was difficult in my youth,[N]
for we lived in a war-torn land,[N]
she always encouraged me to read.[AN]
One day, I asked her why Chouwouj[N]
seemed to be forever in a state of strife.[N]
She said I need to keep reading.[AN]
And so I read. I studied. I visited[N]
sites in enemy territories to further my[N]
understanding of how the world came to be.[AN]
With every layer I peeled back,[N]
like a seemingly endless onion,[N]
there was yet another mystery to solve.[AN]
The work engrossed me, and as a teenager,[N]
I left Chouwouj to travel,[N]
seeking the perspectives of others.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I see.[N]
I, too, knew Lord Dikembe.[AN]
I was in his service for a time[N]
as an advisor much as I am now.[A]
[MidLeft]
Did you know a woman by the[N]
name of Thora?[A]
[MidRight]
Thora[Beat][N]
No, I can't say I do.[A]
[MidLeft]
Lord Dikembe kept many in his ranks.[N]
It's not surprising you've not crossed paths.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Kofi.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, Kwame?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] The book I was reading that day.[N]
The day you first approached me.[AN]
It was about the history of Chouwouj.[N]
It was an account by a eunuch[AN]
from the old royal court.[N]
Surely, you've heard of him.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, Luthando the Engineer.[N]
He was multi-talented.[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed. In this book, he mentions something.[N]
Something that may interest you.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Go on.[A]
[MidRight]
Luthando alludes to a secret place,[N]
in the southernmost reaches of the kingdom.[AN]
Luthando, as you may have known,[N]
was a follower of Cherne.[AN]
If you read his writings, he makes[N]
mention of this in a few places.[AN]
In this account,[N]
he details a hidden shrine.[AN]
A place where he kept writings[N]
that came to him in a trance.[AN]
He heard the call of Cherne,[N]
and wrote down all he could remember.[AN]
He stowed it away in this shrine,[N]
in hopes it would be kept secret[AN]
from those who would persecute him[N]
for revealing himself as a follower.[A]
[MidLeft]
This is quite a reveal.[N]
Could you show me the text?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Perhaps when I finish my review,[N]
I would lend you this account.[AN]
However, when this war is over,[N]
whatever that may come of it[Beat][AN]
You may find answers to what you seek[N]
in Luthando's Shrine deep in the south.[A]
[MidLeft]
This is the first I've heard of it.[N]
I will do more research.[AN]
Perhaps I will return to my homeland[N]
and search for Luthando's Shrine myself.[AN]
I can only imagine what secrets[N]
will be uncovered there[Beat][AN]
But I digress. Kwame.[N]
Thank you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's no trouble at all.[N]
It's[Beat] yes, no trouble.[A][X]
