[OpenMidLeft][LoadKofi][MidRight][LoadNikolas]
[MidRight]Hey there, buddy.[N]
You, with the funny glasses.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hm? Glasses?[N]
Please allow me to correct you.[AN]
These are not glasses, spectacles,[N]
or anything of the sort. It's a monocle.[A]
[MidRight]Spectacles? Aren't those[N]
like a big deal?[AN]
Why would you have one on[N]
your face? Makes no sense. Zilch![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll have you know, words[N]
can mean more than one thing.[AN]
[MidRight]So would you say your[N]
spectacles are spectacular?[AN]
I suppose all spectacles[N]
are spectacular, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, it depends[N]
on which word you are referring-[AN]
Wait, why am I entertaining this?[N]
What do you need from me?[A]
[MidRight]Oh! Thanks for reminding me.[N]
I'm Nikolas.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Kofi.[N]
Well met.[AN]
Now then, what are you here for?[A]
[MidRight]Well, I was sent to find[N]
the front lines a while back.[AN]
And well, I guess I'm in this army now.[N]
Pretty nutty stuff. Quite a spectacle![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmph, I'd say.[N]
But I meant more specifically-[AN]
Bah, forget it for now.[N]
I'd like to get back to the battle.[A][X]

## Kofi_Nikolas_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKofi][MidRight][LoadNikolas]
[MidRight]Hey, Coffee![N]
There you are. Been a minute, huh?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It is [OpenQuote]Kofi", not coffee.[N]
How can I help you, Nikolas?[AN]
You have a penchant for interrupting[N]
me at the most inopportune moments.[A]
[MidRight]Yeah, I know.[N]
I meet you in opportune moments.[AN]
Don't need spectacles to see I'm[N]
pretty spectacular, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's not my point.[N]
I was thinking about something.[A]
[MidRight]Thinking?[N]
That sounds like a bit much.[AN]
We're on the battlefield,[N]
what are you thinking about?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm confident enough in my abilities[N]
to operate fairly efficiently.[AN]
Perhaps to some it is like another[N]
day at the monastery copying documents.[AN]
and so sometimes my mind goes[N]
adrift, wandering into new places.[AN]
[MidRight]Tell me about it![N]
Happens to me all the time.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not surprised to[N]
hear that, Nikolas.[AN]
That said, I'd like to get back to my[N]
thought[Beat] I think I was on verge[AN]
of a breakthough. I just need[N]
to piece a few things together[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]Hmm, you know, I never[N]
asked him why he's even here.[AN]
He was courteous enough to ask me,[N]
but I never returned the favor.[AN]
I think I know how I'll kick off[N]
our next conversation.[AN]
Perhaps I'll bring coffee too.[N]
He seems like someone who would[AN]
appreciate my spectacular brand[N]
of humor. I know it to be true![A][X]

## Kofi_Nikolas_A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKofi]
[MidRight][LoadNikolas]
[MidRight]
Hey there, Kofi![N]
Look what I got for us![AN]
I managed to swing by one of[N]
my favorite new shops in the area.[AN]
Behold! Fresh [OpenQuote]coffee" for[N]
my pal, Kofi![AN]
But wait![N]
There's more![AN]
Aaaaand I got pastries![N]
Look at those cherries![AN]
This one with almond is called[N]
a [OpenQuote]bear claw".[AN]
To be frank, I don't see it.[N]
Only[Beat] [OpenQuote]barely"![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nikolas this is quite possibly[N]
the worst time for this.[AN]
You realize that, don't you?[N]
It's do or die. The battlefield, Nikolas![AN]
[MidRight]
Well, it's like you said.[N]
Sometimes you let your mind wander.[AN]
I figured it'd be okay if you let your[N]
body wander a bit, too.[AN]
At least we'd be doing it together,[N]
you know, as good friends![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
F-friends?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And I was pretty rude.[N]
I never asked you, why are you here?[AN]
Perhaps I could've phrased that a bit[N]
more nicely, but you get what I mean![AN]
How did you end up in this army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm a traveling scholar.[N]
A researcher of sorts.[AN]
One who pursues the truth.[N]
I am particularly interested in history.[A]
[MidRight]
An army doesn't seem like a good place[N]
to study history, to me at least.[AN]
But, hey, what do I know?[N]
I'm just a guy on a flying horse![AN]
Anyway, take a pastry.[N]
And some coffee.[AN]
Cream and sugar?[N]
You seem like the type.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What does that mean?[A]
[MidRight]
I don't even know![N]
My father used to talk about reading folks.[AN]
You know, like people are some kind of book.[N]
He says you can tell a lot about a guy[AN]
by how he takes his coffee.[N]
I think he's pretty crazy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, how does he take[N]
his coffee?[A]
[MidRight]
Black with sugar. Lots of it.[N]
The madman![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph, that is unusual.[N]
Black coffee suits me well, thank you.[A]
[MidRight]
Does your dad drink it black too?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] don't know my father.[N]
In truth, it's part of why[N]
I am drawn to research.[AN]
I hope that someday I may find him.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, don't let it drive you mad![AN]
He probably drinks his coffee with just[N]
sugar, and refers to food as [OpenQuote]refreshments".[N]
I don't get some people![A]
[OpenMidLeft]So, you'd be content to[Beat][N]
leave it alone?[AN]
[MidRight]
Life is short, Kofi.[AN]
I can't go crazy getting[N]
answers to everything.[AN]
Some days I want a pastry and[N]
to feel the wind in my hair.[AN]
Is it so wrong to actively pursue nothing[N]
of greater value to the world?[AN]
Makes me sound kind of selfish, to say it[N]
out loud, but I've always been an odd bird.[AN]
Well, not really a bird, but it's a saying,[N]
you know. Have you heard it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmhmhm. Yes I have, Nikolas.[N]
You do inject levity into situations.[AN]
I will give you that much.[N]
But these distractions cannot stand.[AN]
In addition to the risks posed to ourselves[N]
on the field of battle,[AN]
surely our commanding officers would[N]
take issue with us lounging about.[A]
[MidRight]
What are they going to do?[N]
Not let us fight?[AN]
They're commanding an army,[N]
they need soldiers.[AN]
If we want to take a break and chat,[N]
there's nothing they can do![AN]
Just watch your back for stray arrows.[N]
You get me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
For the first time, Nikolas,[N]
I think I may understand you.[AN]
Perhaps next time we can chat over[N]
coffee in literally any other location.[A][X]

## Kofi_Kwame_C

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][MidRight][LoadKofi]
[MidRight]
Excuse me, Kwame, but I must know,[N]
what is the book you have in your satchel?[A]
[MidLeft]
I was taught it was nosy to ask[N]
others about their possessions.[A]
[MidRight]
Ah, forgive me.[N]
I am a researcher by trade.[AN]
Specifcally interested in the history[N]
of Orodreth and the world at large[Beat][AN]
I suppose nosing where I don't[N]
necessarily belong is a skill of mine.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's not a very becoming trait, you know.[N]
I'm not a musty tome in a lost tomb,[N]
waiting for someone to dust me off.[AN]
I'd prefer to keep my privacy about the[N]
things that I read in my free time.[N]
I trust you can understand this.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm, yes, I can respect your privacy.[N]
I apologize for prying.[A][X]

## Kofi_Kwame_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][MidRight][LoadKofi][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame, I need to ask you[Beat][N]
You know quite a lot of many things,[N]
especially of things long ago, correct?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Why do you ask, Kofi?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm trying to piece together a few[N]
things that were seemingly ommitted[N]
from the Book of Havarti.[AN]
As a scholar and a researcher with an[N]
interest in the Reclamation Wars,[N]
there are few topics more critical.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I can say I know a few things[N]
about the Reclamation Wars, yes.[AN]
Is there something you'd like to know?[N]
Perhaps I could be of use to you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
The Book of Havarti focuses most heavily[N]
on the role of Byelen, the divination[N]
of the weapons, and Abalone IX's fall.[AN]
There are only whispers of another figure[N]
who appears throughout multiple texts,[N]
but seldom is the star of any text.[AN]
While I suspect some ommissions are cultural,[N]
due to the strong political grip of[N]
the Byelen faithful,[AN]
I cannot help but want to better understand[N]
the supposed God of Knowledge, Cherne,[N]
for their impact is felt today, even still.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] In what way?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Is the magic you wield not that[N]
which Cherne brought to the world?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, that much is true.[N]
Followers of Cherne,[AN]
obscure as they may be on the continent,[N]
prefer the use of elder magics, let's say.[AN]
Your observation is astute.[N]
Havarti himself knew little of Cherne,[AN]
and the records of the Reclamation Wars[N]
say little of Cherne's involvement.[A]
[MidRight]
It's a shame[Beat][AN]
The proliferation of Byelen's faithful[N]
have stymied the understanding of truth.[AN]
That's not to say I think Byelen[N]
is a foul deity, not in the slightest,[AN]
but suppressing opposing views limits our[N]
understanding of the world,[AN]
and of our ability to ensure we do not[N]
make the same mistakes of history.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hmm[Beat] Indeed.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I know I've likely been annoying you,[N]
prying into your affairs, Kwame.[AN]
Thank you for entertaining me.[N]
You've given me much to consider.[A]
[MidLeft]
To say I did something would be bombastic,[N]
for in truth, it was nothing at all.[A]
[MidRight]
It's appreciated nonetheless.[N]
We'll speak soon, I'm sure.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
He reminds me of someone.[N]
It makes me wonder[Beat][A][X]

## Kofi_Kwame_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][MidRight][LoadKofi]
[MidLeft]
Kofi. It is now my turn to[N]
ask you a question.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame?[N]
Yes, of course, what is it?[A]
[MidLeft]
How did you come to study history?[N]
How did it become your passion?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I was born in Chouwouj.[N]
My mother was a magic researcher[N]
under the employ of Lord Dikembe.[AN]
[Beat] I never knew my father.[N]
I grew up around books and tomes, and[N]
she instilled in me a love for the unknown.[AN]
Although life was difficult in my youth,[N]
for we lived in a war-torn land,[N]
she always encouraged me to read.[AN]
One day, I asked her why Chouwouj[N]
seemed to be forever in a state of strife.[N]
She said I need to keep reading.[AN]
And so I read. I studied. I visited[N]
sites in enemy territories to further my[N]
understanding of how the world came to be.[AN]
With every layer I peeled back,[N]
like a seemingly endless onion,[N]
there was yet another mystery to solve.[AN]
The work engrossed me, and as a teenager,[N]
I left Chouwouj to travel,[N]
seeking the perspectives of others.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I see.[N]
I, too, knew Lord Dikembe.[AN]
I was in his service for a time[N]
as an advisor much as I am now.[A]
[MidRight]
Did you know a woman by the[N]
name of Thora?[A]
[MidLeft]
Thora[Beat][N]
No, I can't say I do.[A]
[MidRight]
Lord Dikembe kept many in his ranks.[N]
It's not surprising you've not crossed paths.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Kofi.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes, Kwame?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] The book I was reading that day.[N]
The day you first approached me.[AN]
It was about the history of Chouwouj.[AN]
It was an account by a eunuch[N]
from the old royal court.[AN]
Surely, you've heard of him.[A]
[MidRight]
Yes, Luthando the Engineer.[N]
He was multi-talented.[A]
[MidLeft]
Indeed. In this book, he mentions something.[N]
Something that may interest you.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Go on.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Luthando alludes to a secret place,[N]
in the southernmost reaches of the kingdom.[AN]
Luthando, as you may have known,[N]
was a follower of Cherne.[AN]
If you read his writings, he makes[N]
mention of this in a few places.[AN]
In this account,[N]
he details a hidden shrine.[AN]
A place where he kept writings[N]
that came to him in a trance.[AN]
He heard the call of Cherne,[N]
and wrote down all he could remember.[AN]
He stowed it away in this shrine,[N]
in hopes it would be kept secret[AN]
from those who would persecute him[N]
for revealing himself as a follower.[A]
[MidRight]
This is quite a reveal.[N]
Could you show me the text?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Perhaps when I finish my review,[N]
I would lend you this account.[AN]
However, when this war is over,[N]
whatever that may come of it[Beat][AN]
You may find answers to what you seek[N]
in Luthando's Shrine deep in the south.[A]
[MidRight]
This is the first I've heard of it.[N]
I will do more research.[AN]
Perhaps I will return to my homeland[N]
and search for Luthando's Shrine myself.[AN]
I can only imagine what secrets[N]
will be uncovered there[Beat][AN]
But I digress. Kwame.[N]
Thank you.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It's no trouble at all.[N]
It's[Beat] yes, no trouble.[A][X]
