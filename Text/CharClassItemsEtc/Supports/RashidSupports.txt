Hang on just a minute.[N]
What the heck is this!?[AN]
I've never seen a man who[N]
could float before![AN]
At least not one who could float[N]
without, you know, a pegasus.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat] Yes, I suppose I can hover, hm?[N]
I never really considered it odd.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Chief, buddy, my guy - it's weird![N]
But also wild! How do you do it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, I've been this way for a while.[N]
I don't think you fully understand-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't understand at all, but I know[N]
I'd like to try to learn![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I, hrm, don't think I can[Beat][N]
It'd be a lot to explain[Beat][A][X]

## Rashid_Nikolas_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNikolas][OpenMidRight][LoadRashid]
[OpenMidLeft]
So hang on just a minute, Rashid![N]
You never told me your secret![AN]
How do you hover above the ground?[N]
I'm dying to know![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Erm, are you really now?[N]
That may be helpful.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've always been a keen student![N]
That's how I learned to fly a pegasus.[AN]
Now I'd like to learn to fly myself![N]
What's the trick, Rashid?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I was a soldier in the Reclamation Wars.[N]
I was well-feared as The Sidewinder,[N]
a sharpshooter who ensnared my prey.[AN]
I served under the great hero, Hamdi.[N]
After our victory, we sought live everlasting.[N]
To be unspoiled by death evermore.[AN]
It was then when we attempted the ritual,[N]
all of Hamdi's forces were tormented to[N]
eternal purgatory, neither living nor-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nor floating, I presume?[N]
Wait, hang on just one minute![N]
The Reclamation Wars[Beat][AN]
Weren't those a long time ago?[N]
Like, an inordinately long time ago?[N]
How are you still here!?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Did you not just hear what I-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loud and clear! Something about an old war,[N]
something about trying to figure out[AN]
how to make ham not spoil and last forever,[N]
but it all went south![AN]
Still, I don't understand what that[N]
has to do with your abiliy![A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
He must be really sour about[N]
that spoiled ham[Beat][A][X]

## Rashid_Nikolas_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadNikolas][OpenMidRight][LoadRashid]
[OpenMidLeft]
Rashid! I've been searching high and[N]
low for you! Mostly high,[AN]
because well, you know,[N]
the floating and all that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nikolas[Beat] I don't think I am capable[N]
of teaching you how I float.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you think I'm not capable?[N]
Say it ain't so![AN]
At least have the courtesty[N]
to lay me down easy, Rashid![A]
[OpenMidRight]
It isn't a question of ability,[N]
although I'd not be wrong to question it.[AN]
I'm dead, Nikolas. I'm a ghost.[N]
A phantom. My spirit lingers,[AN]
unable to depart this world for any[N]
other. It is a scar of my hubris.[AN]
My ability to [OpenQuote]float", as you call it,[N]
is because I am not bound to mortal laws.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Woah, hang on, you're dead?[N]
But you're right here![AN]
You gotta show me that trick too![N]
I've heard of playing dead,[AN]
but you make it look as easy[N]
as living! Impressive stuff, Rashid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You want me to teach you[N]
[Beat] how to die?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
If that's what it takes to fly,[N]
then maybe[Beat] Actually, no.[AN]
I don't think I'm keen to die.[N]
Life is too good to throw away![AN]
You've been so dodgy about your secrets,[N]
it could be a plan to lead me astray![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Dodgy? I've been nothing of the sort.[N]
You keep interru-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I didn't know ghosts could get mad![N]
I see through your tricks, Rashid![AN]
You had me going for a while,[N]
and although impressive, you can't fool me![A]
[OpenMidRight]
If only it weren't so easy[Beat][A][X]
