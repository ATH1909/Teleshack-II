Nora.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah, hello, Lady Iberis.[N]
Do you require my aid?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, that will not be[N]
reqired.[AN]
You are doing an admirable[N]
job in your duty.[AN]
Perhaps too admirable.[AN]
In the span of a year you've[N]
jumped from a common soldier[AN]
to one of Korovai's most[N]
trusted allies.[AN]
[MidRight]
Is this an accusation of[N]
something, Lady Iberis?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, at least for now.[AN]
Merely an independent[N]
investigation on my part.[AN]
I wish you well, Nora.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
How odd[Beat][AN]
What game are you[N]
playing, Iberis?[AN][X]

[MidRight]
Lady Iberis, were you in[N]
my tent yesterday?[AN]
[MidLeft]
What is this about,[N]
Nora?[AN]
[MidRight]
Various items of mine[N]
were tampered with[AN]
when I went to bed[N]
last night.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, yes.[AN]
Merely a continuation of[N]
that investigation.[AN]
But I must ask, how long do[N]
you intend to stay with[AN]
the Liberators now that[N]
Korovai is gone.[AN]
[MidRight]
I intend to continue to aid[N]
those of Freyse who still[AN]
wish to support the Liberators'[N]
ambitions of stopping Cythes.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmm, I see.[AN]
Very well, Nora.
You may be on your way.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Does she think I'm a[N] 
traitor?[AN]
Preposterous![AN][X]

Hello, Nora.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Lady Iberis.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I owe you an explanation[N]
for my behavior.[AN]
Given your circumstances, I[N]
did have some suspicion[AN]
of your motives and ability,[N]
given the popularity of espionage,[AN]
whether it be Cythean or a[N]
rival of Lord Korovai.[AN]
However, based on my findings[N]
and observations,[AN]
these beliefs were completely[N]
unfounded.[AN]
I apologize for any inconvenience[N]
I've caused, Nora.[AN]
[MidRight]
I understand.[N]
All is forgiven.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Then let us be off.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Iberis not flaunting her[N]
pride and arrogance for once?[AN]
Maybe she's the suspicious one,[N]
heh heh.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
The same disinterested[N]
stare as usual[Beat][AN]
Even in the middle of the[N]
fight to save Freyse,[AN]
can you not even flare up the[N]
tiniest spark of passion?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's the damn point,[N]
Nora?[AN]
What reward lies atop the[N]
mountain of corpses[AN]
we've helped to create?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Honor for our house and[N]
revenge for the innocent![AN]
Surely there's no greater
cause to fight for![AN]
[MidRight]
Pah, revenge and honor won't[N]
bring them back.[AN]
Now, leave me be in[N]
peace, Nora.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Wait, Hans![N]
Return here at once![AN]
Blast it, he's[N]
gone.[AN][X]

Are you alright?[A]
[MidLeft]
Alright?[N]
Alright!?[AN]
The lord I've devoted[N]
everything to serving[AN]
was just killed, and your[N]
blank face isn't helping![AN]
[MidRight]
Nora[Beat][AN]
I DO care about what[N]
happened to Korovai![AN]
I know that sounds wild,[N]
but I'm not a heartless monster![AN]
This would not be the first time[N]
I've had to deal with this![AN]
Death and loss defined my[N]
life, Nora.[AN]
I lost someone very close to[N]
me earlier in the war[Beat][AN]
Before I joined up with[N]
you and Korovai.[AN]
I fought off and slew the commander[N]
who took their life,[AN]
but I felt nothing from that[N]
victory.[AN]
It was there I realized that[N]
ambitions were a waste of energy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then what drives you, then?[AN]
Surely you wouldn't care about[N]
revenge now.[AN]
[MidRight]
I just want this all to[N]
be over.[AN]
I don't give a damn about[N]
glory, revenge, or honor.[AN]
All I want is a day I can wake[N]
up knowing that we're all free[AN]
from this cycle of ludicrosity.[AN]

Hans[Beat][AN]
I-I[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
I don't expect any pity,[N]
Nora.[AN]
Please, let us just[N]
focus on the war.[AN][ClearFace]
