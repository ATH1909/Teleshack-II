[MidLeft]
The same disinterested[N]
stare as usual[Beat][AN]
Even in the middle of the[N]
fight to save Freyse,[AN]
can you not even flare up the[N]
tiniest spark of passion?[AN]
[MidRight]
What's the damn point,[N]
Nora?[AN]
What reward lies atop the[N]
mountain of corpses[AN]
we've helped to create?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Honor for our house and[N]
revenge for the innocent![AN]
Surely there's no greater
cause to fight for![AN]
[MidRight]
Pah, revenge and honor won't[N]
bring them back.[AN]
Now, leave me be in[N]
peace, Nora.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Wait, Hans![N]
Return here at once![AN]
Blast it, he's[N]
gone.[AN][X]

Nora[Beat][N]
Are you alright?[A]
[MidLeft]
Alright?[N]
Alright!?[AN]
The lord I've devoted[N]
everything to serving[AN]
was just killed, and your[N]
blank face isn't helping![AN]
[MidRight]
Nora[Beat][AN]
I DO care about what[N]
happened to Korovai![AN]
I know that sounds wild,[N]
but I'm not a heartless monster![AN]
This would not be the first time[N]
I've had to deal with this![AN]
Death and loss defined my[N]
life, Nora.[AN]
I lost someone very close to[N]
me earlier in the war[Beat][AN]
Before I joined up with[N]
you and Korovai.[AN]
I fought off and slew the commander[N]
who took their life,[AN]
but I felt nothing from that[N]
victory.[AN]
It was there I realized that[N]
ambitions were a waste of energy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then what drives you, then?[AN]
Surely you wouldn't care about[N]
revenge now.[AN]
[MidRight]
I just want this all to[N]
be over.[AN]
I don't give a damn about[N]
glory, revenge, or honor.[AN]
All I want is a day I can wake[N]
up knowing that we're all free[AN]
from this cycle of ludicrosity.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hans[Beat][AN]
I-I[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
I don't expect any pity,[N]
Nora.[AN]
Please, let us just[N]
focus on the war.[AN][ClearFace]

Hello, Nora.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ah, Ichwep.[AN]
Is there anything[N]
you needed?[AN]
[MidRight]
I have recently thought about[N]
how better to serve House Freyse.[AN]
And my conclusion was that I could[N]
serve from the sky, on a wyvern.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then I presume you want[N]
me to give you flight lessons.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
That is correct.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then I will need some time[N]
to prepare lessons.[AN]
[MidRight]
Very well, then.[AN]
I will wait as long[N]
as I need to.[AN][X]

[MidLeft]
Ichwep, are you[N]
open for some lessons?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Well, about that[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Are those bruises?[AN]
Did you try to fly[N]
on your own?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yeah[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, I guess that'll[N]
start our first lesson:[AN]
when to and when not[N]
to get on a mount.[AN][X]

Hey, Nora.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What do you[N]
need, Ichwep?[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't think I'm cut[N]
out for flight.[AN]
I keep putting my all into[N]
it, but I'm not getting anywhere.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're doing admirably,[N]
Ichwep.[AN]
Wyvern flight is a tricky[N]
skill to master.[AN]
But if you put your mind[N]
to it,[AN]
we can get you there![AN]
[MidRight]
Well, if you think I[N]
can do it,[AN]
I guess I'll keep on[N]
trying.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Thats the spirit![AN][X]
