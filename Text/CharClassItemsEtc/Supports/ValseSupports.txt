What's wrong? You seem[Beat] troubled.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Was it that obvious? Well, you always[N]
could see right through me.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
True, but it was still really obvious.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's just[Beat] We signed up with the[N]
Liberators because of Korovai.[AN]
And now he's gone, Freyse is free, and[N]
I'm not sure how I fit in here anymore.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Do you want to leave? You could head[N]
back home and no one would blame you.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I just don't know![AN]
Heck, I never wanted to fight in the[N]
first place, I only picked up my spear[N]
to keep the people I care about safe.[AN]
But we did it, we won, and yet[N]
here we are, still fighting.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Huh, I hadn't thought[N]
about it that way.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You hadn't? What's making you stick[N]
around then? Don't tell me you're[N]
too invested in the cause to quit.[A]
[MidRight]
Of course not. I don't think we're[N]
on the wrong side, and I still don't[N]
like Cythes,[A] but also I don't[N]
dislike fighting like you do.[AN]
It's a job, and I'm good at it.[N]
Honestly, you're good at it too.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I don't think I could ever think[N]
of this as just a job[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You don't have to. If you're looking[N]
for permission to quit and go home,[N]
I'll grant it to you.[AN]
No point staying if you're just[N]
gonna mope about it.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Can't argue with that. Looks like[N]
I've got some thinking to do[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You're looking better today.[N]
Sorted out your worries already?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, I mean, I think so.[AN]
It doesn't matter if we're fighting[N]
for Freyse or for the entire continent,[AN]
as long as the Liberators are fighting[N]
to help people, I'd like to do the same.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I figured it'd be something like that.[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
What can I say? I'm a simple guy.[N]
I can't stand idle against injustice.[AN]
Still, thanks for helping me make[N]
up my mind.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What are you talking about? All I did[N]
was tell you it was fine to leave. If[N]
you want. Which you didn't do.[A]
[MidLeft]
Heh, when you put it like that I see[N]
what you mean. Still, you got me to[N]
think about what I really wanted to do.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Sometimes I have no idea what[N]
goes on in your head.[A]
[MidLeft]
And I always thought you knew[N]
me better than anyone.[AN]
Either way, I appreciate you checking[N]
up on me. You're a good friend.[A]
[MidRight]
Good friend, huh[Beat][N]
Thanks, or you're welcome?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't worry about it. Now, we've[N]
still got some enemies to take out.[N]
Let's go![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I've got your back, as always.[A][X]

You there, what is the meaning of this?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You're Carl, right? I'm afraid I[N]
don't quite know what you mean.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Don't feign ignorance![N]
You may have the others fooled,[N]
but I see right through you![A]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I don't have the slightest[N]
clue what you're on about![AN]
We're on the same side here, so let's[N]
win this battle, then we can chat.[A]
[MidRight]
No, this cannot wait! I have to know[Beat][N]
What is the secret behind your[N]
spearfighting technique?[A]
[MidLeft]
Technique? Secret? What're you talkin'[N]
about? I just point my spear at the[N]
enemy and thrust.[A]
[MidRight]
Just point and thrust? How absurd![AN]
That can't possibly be it. This army[N]
has so many accomplished warriors,[N]
and yet, you stand out among them.[AN]
No one else fights in such an[N]
indiscernible yet confident manner.[AN]
I must learn the secrets behind[N]
your seemingly unremarkable, yet[N]
ineffective effective spearwork.[A]
[MidLeft]
I dunno what to tell ya,[N]
I don't really have a technique.[N]
I mostly go off instinct I guess.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You still deny it? No matter, with[N]
time I will uncover your secret.[AN]
No hidden technique can elude me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
I'll learn every move there is to[N]
know, however obscure it may be.[AN]
Nothing is beyond my-[N]
Wait, where'd he go?[AN]
Slipped right through my fingers[Beat][N]
An expert in both stealth and spearwork.[AN]
You may act naive, but I won't be[N]
deceived. I'm onto you, Valse[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight]
There you are! You won't slip away this[N]
time. Today, I'll learn your secrets![A]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I don't have any secrets![N]
With me, what you see if what you get.[AN]
I'm just an ordinary guy, fighing for[N]
a cause I believe in.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Impossible[Beat] No, could it be?[AN]
To fight so magnificently, without[N]
any technique at all, you must be a[AN]
true prodigy! A once in a generation[N]
virtuoso of immeasurable talent![AN]
Imagine what you could do with some[N]
real training, from a master spearman.[N]
You'd be unstoppable![A]
[MidLeft]
That was a compliment, right?[N]
Thanks, I guess, but also sorry.[AN]
I'm not interested in mastering[N]
the spear. After this war, I don't[N]
plan on doing any more fighting.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You would waste such talent?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'm not like you, Carl. I don't care[N]
about being the strongest, I just[N]
want to win this war and go home.[AN]
[MidRight]
So you say, but if you truly desired[N]
victory, you'd do whatever it takes,[N]
wouldn't you?[A] Yet you won't even try[N]
to improve your spearwork, for the sake[N]
of winning the war?[A] Mark my words,[N]
talent alone will only get you so far.[A][X]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Carl, you've got some explaining to do![A]
[MidRight]
What are you talking about?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You're gonna tell me it's a coincidence[N]
that three different spearfighters[N]
asked to train with me since our chat?[A]
[MidRight]
Urgh[Beat] Shoulda been more subtle, huh?[N]
But you still did it, didn't you?[N]
I can tell you've been practicing.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, I hate to admit it, but[N]
when you're right, you're right.[AN]
I want to win this war, and I'll do[N]
whatever I can to make that happen.[A]
[MidRight]
Long ago, on the outskirts of Cythes,[AN]
I witnessed a lone zealot repel a[N]
dozen hardened mercenaries, armed[N]
with nothing but his cudgel.[AN]
His incredible fervor almost[N]
made up for his lack of training.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Almost?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, we got him eventually.[N]
Don't worry, he was a bad guy,[N]
some follower of a dark god.[AN]
Anyway, the point is that fighting[N]
for your convictions is its own kind[N]
of strength,[A] just don't get yourself[N]
killed doing it.[AN]
Not everyone is meant to walk the[N]
same path as I, after all.[A]
[MidLeft]
Strange story aside, thanks, Carl.[N]
Despite all our differences,[N]
I'm glad to have you as an ally.[A]
[MidRight]
Heh, same to you, Valse.[N]
After this, battle, let's spar.[N]
I'd like to test your progress myself.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sounds good. Maybe even you'll[N]
learn a thing or two.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'd expect nothing less.[A][X]
