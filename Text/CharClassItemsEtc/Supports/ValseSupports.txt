You there, what is the meaning of this?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You're Carl, right? I'm afraid I[N]
don't quite know what you mean.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Don't feign ignorance![N]
You may have the others fooled,[N]
but I see right through you![A]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I don't have the slightest[N]
clue what you're on about![AN]
We're on the same side here, so let's[N]
win this battle, then we can chat.[A]
[MidRight]
No, this cannot wait! I have to know[Beat][N]
What is the secret behind your[N]
spearfighting technique?[A]
[MidLeft]
Technique? Secret? What're you talkin'[N]
about? I just point my spear at the[N]
enemy and thrust.[A]
[MidRight]
Just point and thrust? How absurd![AN]
That can't possibly be it. This army[N]
has so many accomplished warriors,[N]
and yet, you stand out among them.[AN]
No one else fights in such an[N]
indiscernible yet confident manner.[AN]
I must learn the secrets behind[N]
your seemingly unremarkable, yet[N]
ineffective effective spearwork.[A]
[MidLeft]
I dunno what to tell ya,[N]
I don't really have a technique.[N]
I mostly go off instinct I guess.[A]
[MidRight]
You still deny it? No matter, with[N]
time I will uncover your secret.[AN]
No hidden technique can elude me.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
I'll learn every move there is to[N]
know, however obscure it may be.[AN]
Nothing is beyond my-[N]
Wait, where'd he go?[AN]
Slipped right through my fingers[Beat][N]
An expert in both stealth and spearwork.[N]
You may act naive, but I won't be[N]
deceived. I'm onto you, Valse[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight]
There you are! You won't slip away this[N]
time. Today, I'll learn your secrets![A]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I don't have any secrets![N]
With me, what you see if what you get.[AN]
I'm just an ordinary guy, fighing for[N]
a cause I believe in.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Impossible[Beat] No, could it be?[AN]
To fight so magnificently, without[N]
any technique at all, you must be a[AN]
true prodigy! A once in a generation[N]
virtuoso of immeasurable talent![AN]
Imagine what you could do with some[N]
real training, from a master spearman.[N]
You'd be unstoppable![A]
[MidLeft]
That was a compliment, right?[N]
Thanks, I guess, but also sorry.[AN]
I'm not interested in mastering[N]
the spear. After this war, I don't[N]
plan on doing any more fighting.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You would waste such talent?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'm not like you, Carl. I don't care[N]
about being the strongest, I just[N]
want to win this war and go home.[AN]
[MidRight]
So you say, but if you truly desired[N]
victory, you'd do whatever it takes,[N]
wouldn't you? Yet you won't even try[AN]
to improve your spearwork, for the sake[N]
of winning the war? Mark my words,[AN]
talent alone will only get you so far.[A][X]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Carl, you've got some explaining to do![A]
[MidRight]
What are you talking about?[A]
[MidLeft]
You're gonna tell me it's a coincidence[N]
that three different spearfighters[N]
asked to train with me since our chat?[A]
[MidRight]
Urgh[Beat] Shoulda been more subtle, huh?[N]
But you still did it, didn't you?[N]
I can tell you've been practicing.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, I hate to admit it, but[N]
when you're right, you're right.[AN]
I want to win this war, and I'll do[N]
whatever I can to make that happen.[A]
[MidRight]
Long ago, on the outskirts of Cythes,[AN]
I witnessed a lone zealot repel a[N]
dozen hardened mercenaries, armed[N]
with nothing but his cudgel.[AN]
His incredible fervor almost[N]
made up for his lack of training.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Almost?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, we got him eventually.[N]
Don't worry, he was a bad guy,[N]
some follower of a dark god.[AN]
Anyway, the point is that fighting[N]
for your convictions is its own kind[AN]
of strength, just don't get yourself[N]
killed doing it.[AN]
Not everyone is meant to walk the[N]
same path as I, after all.[A]
[MidLeft]
Strange story aside, thanks, Carl.[N]
Despite all our differences,[N]
I'm glad to have you as an ally.[A]
[MidRight]
Heh, same to you, Valse.[N]
After this, battle, let's spar.[N]
I'd like to test your progress myself.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sounds good. Maybe even you'll[N]
learn a thing or two.[A]
[MidRight]
I'd expect nothing less.[A][X]
