[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, that's not right at all.[N]
This version of the grand tale[Beat][N]
it contradicts the other texts.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? Cadenza? What are you on about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Kofi[Beat][N]
I'm reading source material, seeking[N]
inspiration for a new song.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What sorts of [OpenQuote]source material"[N]
are you looking for? Perhaps[N]
I can help you find it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's a bit obscure, I couldn't[N]
expect just anyone to know it.[N]
I wouldn't dare trouble you with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm a student of history, Cadenza,[N]
I specialize in the obscure, the arcane,[N]
the esoteric, and the forgotten.[AN]
If there's someone who's willing to[N]
be troubled with tracking down a text,[N]
it's probably myself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph, well, surely you're familiar with Cherne.[N]
Knowledge of Cherne is how I separate[N]
the informed from the uninformed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, I am familiar with Cherne.[N]
Some call them the god of knowledge.[N]
Others, the god of darkness.[AN]
For if Byelen is light, all other gods[N]
must in turn be their shadow.[N]
Does this satisfy you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps you may be useful yet.[N]
I have a vision for a song.[N]
A sorrowful tune it will be.[AN]
Cherne is something of a tragic[N]
figure, although few would have[N]
sympathy given their moniker.[AN]
Let's discuss this more later,[N]
for there is still much I am[N]
looking to know.[A][X]

## Cadenza_Kofi_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
[OpenMidLeft]
Kofi! Have you been able to uncover[N]
anything pertaining to my request?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Not much. I don't know how you came[N]
upon such a bizarre request.[AN]
Usually those with any interest of history[N]
care only for battles and grand heroes,[AN]
or dates of ascension and death.[N]
I've never been asked to look into[Beat][AN]
something so strange.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What is so strange about it?[N]
Is it not relevant?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I fail to see the relevance[N]
surrounding what food Cherne enjoyed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't be so stuffy![N]
Food is what connects us all.[AN]
We call building friendships[N]
[OpenQuote]breaking bread", after all.[AN]
What could be of greater historical[N]
relevance to the modern reader than this?[AN]
There's something humbling in knowing[N]
a great queen of long ago also enjoyed[AN]
the same type of dish as you.[N]
No matter who you are, we all must eat![A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, but is it historically significant?[N]
Nothing I've been able to find seems to[N]
care much about Cherne's diet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hmph, I suppose I was wrong about you, Kofi.[N]
I thought you'd understand[Beat][AN]
I suppose I'll need to make something[N]
up then. I'll find the words that rhyme.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You'd write a historically inaccurate tale[N]
just for the sake of rhythm!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If I cannot find out what sort of foods[N]
Cherne truly enjoyed, I am left to guess.[AN]
Perhaps in time, this would be accepted[N]
as historical fact, a myth turned into truth.[AN]
Regardless, I must be off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
He's mad! While art is not subject[N]
to the same scrutiny as history,[N]
falsehoods are blemishes![AN]
What a disservice we'd do to future[N]
generations by intentionally feeding them[N]
lies of the past they accept as truth.[AN]
No[Beat] I must find out the truth[N]
so that the song is precise![N]
I'll stay up all night if I must[Beat][A][X]

## Cadenza_Kofi_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
Cadenza.[N]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm? Kofi?[N]
You look terrible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've not slept for four days.[N]
I was researching, cross-referencing[Beat][AN]
I can barely put words together anymore[N]
but I think I found it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, you know what foods Cherne truly[N]
enjoyed? Pray tell, for I am curious![A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
According to historians, Cherne never[N]
really cared much for food.[N]
To Cherne, it was a means to an end.[AN]
[OpenQuote]To survive, we eat.[N]
The animals all eat what minimum they need[N]
to live, and so I will do the same.[AN]
For eating too much slows the mind[N]
to speed up the stomach,[N]
and poor mind is to be avoided."[AN]
There are a few other anecdotes[N]
stating Cherne enjoyed pistachios,[N]
requesting them occasionally,[AN]
but there is little evidence Cherne[N]
actually had any great love for cuisine.[N]
I'm sure this is disappointing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's it!?[N]
To be the god of knowledge and have[N]
no knowledge of cuisine[Beat][AN]
It is a crime, a shame, a farce![N]
Who is writing these records?[N]
I will rewrite history myself![A]
[OpenMidRight]
You mustn't![N]
It's critical we maintain historical accuracy.[N]
We risk diluting the truth![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You know full well the power of song, Kofi.[N]
I'd never be able to find something[N]
that rhymed with pistachio.[AN]
The song would be ruined.[N]
Utterly ruined, destroyed,[N]
dead on arrival![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You're kidding, right?[N]
There are plenty of words that rhyme.[N]
Pistachio may sound odd,[AN]
but it shares many common[N]
syllables with words we use daily.[N]
Allow me to share a few.[AN]
Pistachio, overflow, pastry dough,[N]
overthrow, patio, undergrow, vertigo,[N]
red willow, mistletoe-[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's it![N]
The mistletoe! It fits![N]
I think I have it now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What!? You can't use mistletoe,[N]
there's nothing in the record[N]
that suggests Cherne even saw mistletoe![AN]
Cherne may have never come across[N]
the parasitic plant.[N]
It'd be spreading a lie.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't care, I've been stuck on the[N]
bridge of this tune for ages.[N]
As far as everyone will know,[AN]
Cherne eats pistachios while[N]
watching the mistletoes.[N]
It sounds lovely, doesn't it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nonsense! Utter nonsense![N]
How can you be so irresponsible?[AN]
Are bards not meant to[N]
sing historical truths?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you wish it to be so, Kofi,[N]
maybe you can find evidence of Cherne[N]
talking about the plant?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] I'm going to need more than[N]
a few pistachios to get through this.[A][X]
