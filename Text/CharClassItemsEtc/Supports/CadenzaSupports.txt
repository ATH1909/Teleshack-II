[MidLeft][LoadMink]
What an interesting form of magic[N]
you've perfected.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Weaving spell into song. It's as[N]
wondrous as it is effective.[AN]
[MidRight]
There is nothing wondrous[N]
about my melodies.[AN]
I sing of tragedy and sorrow;[N]
the world as it is.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
As it is? There's certainly[N]
no shortage of inspiration[N]
for a muse of despair.[AN]
But the world and the course[N]
of history is more than[N]
suffering and misery, friend.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
A fool you are, young Mink.[AN] 
A fool whose tomes[N]
know not true wisdom,[N]
only shadowed past.[AN]
Your naive heart through[N]
faerie garden roams[AN]
sees not the world,[N]
only rose-colored past.[AN]
A brat you are, young Mink.[N]
Precocious pup[AN]
who hides within the[N]
violet robes of he[AN]
who is a student too.[N]
From him you sup[AN]
mere seeds of knowlege,[N]
never full-grown tree.[AN]
A waste you are, young Mink.[N]
You never found[AN]
the blossomed beauty of[N]
the written word,[AN]
nor poetry. To past alone,[N]
you're bound,[AN]
mind caged, never to fly[N] 
free as a bird.[AN]
The arts are not a path you truly walk,[N]
o Mink, o fellow bard - o foolish hack.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Did he just-?![AN]
Why, the nerve![A] When next we meet,[N]
I'll expose him for the fraud he is![A][X]

## CadenzaMink_B
[MidRight][LoadCadenza]
[MidLeft][LoadMink]
We meet again.[AN]
[MidRight]
Come to spew some more[N]
drivel of-[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
O Cadenza, you call[N]
me a mere fool,[AN]
an immature fawn who[N]
through forest twirled,[AN]
Yet what are you?[AN]
Your ink-stained[N]
tongue, so cruel,[AN]
but eyes stained dark[N]
that cannot see the world.[AN]
The arts are wonder[N]
beyond mortal mind,[AN]
that every man must[N]
witness for his own.[AN]
In your doomed efforts[N]
to appear unkind,[AN]
you reduce your heart[N]
to lifeless bone.[AN]
In wond'rous world,[N]
no beauty you can spot.[AN]
How you claim to[N]
be wise, a mystery.[AN]
To your fool mind, this[N]
land's just inky blot,[AN]
with no room for[N]
wonder or history.[AN]
The arts are not a path you truly walk,[AN]
o Cadenza, o fellow bard - o hack.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
So the arts are just a[N] 
game for you, then?[AN]
Matters of the soul, the[N]
punchline of a joke?[AN][OpenEyes]
Mark my words, I'll show you[N]
the true face of our world.[A][X]

[Beat][Beat][AN]
[FarLeft]
O Cadenza, heart stained black,[AN]
when you fail to keep up with me,[N]
I wonder what you'll think.[AN]
[FarRight]
I fear you not, perspective you lack.[AN]
I see not a scholar but fool, concerned[N]
all too much with posturing, O Mink.[AN]
What wisdom's there to be found in a[N]
man obsessed with pride, you rat.[AN]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
There is no shame, to love the world,[AN]
beautiful world, stories[N]
ripe for plunder.[AN]
Yet a waste is it all,[N]
in the face of light,[AN]
all and right, you spat.[AN]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
I expose the truth, shatter[N]
the masks people wear,[AN]
all these fake[N]
smiles I sunder.[AN]
Your words full[N]
of empty fluff;[AN]
what little creativity[N]
spent in vain.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
You're a blade with sharp[N]
edge, but no point.[AN]
I see through it, that[N]
facade you project.[AN]
You see my wisdom, but[N]
refuse to learn,[AN]
and just sorrow and[N]
suffering, you feign.[AN]
For history's the[N]
finest muse of all![AN]
From her, the greatest[N]
tales we can pluck.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
The past is flames, its words[N]
mere dancing wind.[AN]
Their face is only[N]
worthy to reject.[AN]
You spew disdain,[N]
naivety, to seek[AN]
mere petty pleasures,[N]
mere fine wine, mere fu-[AN]
[Beat][AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Duck?[A]
[Right]
Mere petty pleasures, mere[N] 
fine wine, roast duck.[AN]

[Beat]Stumble at the end[N]
aside, not bad[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]An adequate performance[N]
from you as well[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
This will not be the last[N]
you see of me, o fellow bard.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh.[AN]
Do not disappoint me,[N]
o foolish hack.[A][X]

## Cadenza_Kofi_C

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, that's not right at all.[N]
This version of the grand tale[Beat][N]
it contradicts the other texts.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? Cadenza? What are you on about?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Kofi[Beat][N]
I'm reading source material, seeking[N]
inspiration for a new song.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What sorts of [OpenQuote]source material"[N]
are you looking for? Perhaps[N]
I can help you find it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's a bit obscure, I couldn't[N]
expect just anyone to know it.[N]
I wouldn't dare trouble you with it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm a student of history, Cadenza,[N]
I specialize in the obscure, the arcane,[N]
the esoteric, and the forgotten.[AN]
If there's someone who's willing to[N]
be troubled with tracking down a text,[N]
it's probably myself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmph, well, surely you're familiar with Cherne.[N]
Knowledge of Cherne is how I separate[N]
the informed from the uninformed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, I am familiar with Cherne.[N]
Some call them the god of knowledge.[N]
Others, the god of darkness.[AN]
For if Byelen is light, all other gods[N]
must in turn be their shadow.[N]
Does this satisfy you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Perhaps you may be useful yet.[N]
I have a vision for a song.[N]
A sorrowful tune it will be.[AN]
Cherne is something of a tragic[N]
figure, although few would have[N]
sympathy given their moniker.[AN]
Let's discuss this more later,[N]
for there is still much I am[N]
looking to know.[A][X]

## Cadenza_Kofi_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
[OpenMidLeft]
Kofi! Have you been able to uncover[N]
anything pertaining to my request?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Not much. I don't know how you came[N]
upon such a bizarre request.[AN]
Usually those with any interest of history[N]
care only for battles and grand heroes,[AN]
or dates of ascension and death.[N]
I've never been asked to look into[Beat][AN]
something so strange.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What is so strange about it?[N]
Is it not relevant?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I fail to see the relevance[N]
surrounding what food Cherne enjoyed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't be so stuffy![N]
Food is what connects us all.[AN]
We call building friendships[N]
[OpenQuote]breaking bread", after all.[AN]
What could be of greater historical[N]
relevance to the modern reader than this?[AN]
There's something humbling in knowing[N]
a great queen of long ago also enjoyed[AN]
the same type of dish as you.[N]
No matter who you are, we all must eat![A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, but is it historically significant?[N]
Nothing I've been able to find seems to[N]
care much about Cherne's diet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hmph, I suppose I was wrong about you, Kofi.[N]
I thought you'd understand[Beat][AN]
I suppose I'll need to make something[N]
up then. I'll find the words that rhyme.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You'd write a historically inaccurate tale[N]
just for the sake of rhythm!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If I cannot find out what sort of foods[N]
Cherne truly enjoyed, I am left to guess.[AN]
Perhaps in time, this would be accepted[N]
as historical fact, a myth turned into truth.[AN]
Regardless, I must be off.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
He's mad! While art is not subject[N]
to the same scrutiny as history,[N]
falsehoods are blemishes![AN]
What a disservice we'd do to future[N]
generations by intentionally feeding them[N]
lies of the past they accept as truth.[AN]
No[Beat] I must find out the truth[N]
so that the song is precise![N]
I'll stay up all night if I must[Beat][A][X]

## Cadenza_Kofi_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCadenza][OpenMidRight][LoadKofi]
Cadenza.[N]
There you are.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hm? Kofi?[N]
You look terrible.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've not slept for four days.[N]
I was researching, cross-referencing[Beat][AN]
I can barely put words together anymore[N]
but I think I found it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, you know what foods Cherne truly[N]
enjoyed? Pray tell, for I am curious![A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
According to historians, Cherne never[N]
really cared much for food.[N]
To Cherne, it was a means to an end.[AN]
[OpenQuote]To survive, we eat.[N]
The animals all eat what minimum they need[N]
to live, and so I will do the same.[AN]
For eating too much slows the mind[N]
to speed up the stomach,[N]
and poor mind is to be avoided."[AN]
There are a few other anecdotes[N]
stating Cherne enjoyed pistachios,[N]
requesting them occasionally,[AN]
but there is little evidence Cherne[N]
actually had any great love for cuisine.[N]
I'm sure this is disappointing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's it!?[N]
To be the god of knowledge and have[N]
no knowledge of cuisine[Beat][AN]
It is a crime, a shame, a farce![N]
Who is writing these records?[N]
I will rewrite history myself![A]
[OpenMidRight]
You mustn't![N]
It's critical we maintain historical accuracy.[N]
We risk diluting the truth![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You know full well the power of song, Kofi.[N]
I'd never be able to find something[N]
that rhymed with pistachio.[AN]
The song would be ruined.[N]
Utterly ruined, destroyed,[N]
dead on arrival![AN]
[OpenMidRight]
You're kidding, right?[N]
There are plenty of words that rhyme.[N]
Pistachio may sound odd,[AN]
but it shares many common[N]
syllables with words we use daily.[N]
Allow me to share a few.[AN]
Pistachio, overflow, pastry dough,[N]
overthrow, patio, undergrow, vertigo,[N]
red willow, mistletoe-[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's it![N]
The mistletoe! It fits![N]
I think I have it now.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
What!? You can't use mistletoe,[N]
there's nothing in the record[N]
that suggests Cherne even saw mistletoe![AN]
Cherne may have never come across[N]
the parasitic plant.[N]
It'd be spreading a lie.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't care, I've been stuck on the[N]
bridge of this tune for ages.[N]
As far as everyone will know,[AN]
Cherne eats pistachios while[N]
watching the mistletoes.[N]
It sounds lovely, doesn't it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Nonsense! Utter nonsense![N]
How can you be so irresponsible?[AN]
Are bards not meant to[N]
sing historical truths?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you wish it to be so, Kofi,[N]
maybe you can find evidence of Cherne[N]
talking about the plant?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] I'm going to need more than[N]
a few pistachios to get through this.[A][X]
