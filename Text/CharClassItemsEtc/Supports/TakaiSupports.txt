Oy, Tobie! Wait up for yer pa,[N]
will ya? That pegasus of yers[N]
is too fast for me to keep up![AN]
[MidLeft]
What sense does that make, Dad?[AN]
Buck here can take me anywhere,[N]
no matter what obstacle we face,[N]
and our army is counting on that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Are they, really? The way I see it,[N]
our two commanders both got wings[N]
o' their own. Why not let them lead?[AN]
Then ye can handle the rearguard,[N]
usin' ol' Buck to get places that[N]
the rest of us can't reach.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And then what? What if they think[N]
I'm a coward, and stop deploying me?[AN]
I don't want to sit on the sidelines.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, would that be so bad?[AN]
At least ye'd be safe, Tobie.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]So that's what this was about.[N]
You don't think I can handle myself?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What? No, I never said that,[N]
but a parent always worries,[N]
and ye never know what may happen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you have nothing to worry about.[N]
I don't need to be sitting right next[N]
to you in order to stay safe.[AN]
If you don't believe me,[N]
then I'll just have to show you![AN]
C'mon Buck, let's take them down![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
W-Wait, Tobie![N]
There're archers that way![AN][CloseEyes]
Oh, Teresa[Beat][N]
Where did we go wrong?[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadTobie]
[MidRight][LoadTakai][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]So, are ye ready to talk about it?[AN]
Ye've been avoidin' me recently,[N]
but don't think I forgot, Tobie.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Talk about what?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ye know what I mean, but fine.[N]
I'm talkin' about that stunt[N]
you pulled, flyin' into archers.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, it worked out, didn't it?[AN]
I'm still alive, and they're not.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Because I leaped in and beat them[N]
all down! Do ye have any idea how[N]
close they were to hittin' ya?[AN]
I saw an arrow whiz right past[N]
poor Buck's head, and ye would've[N]
fallen straight to the ground![AN]
Did ye ever think of that?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I just wanted to show that[N]
I could fight like everyone else.[AN][CloseEyes]
But[Beat] clearly, I[Beat] I can't.[N]
Why did I have to be so weak?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, Tobie[Beat] Ye don't need to cry.[N]
I didn't mean to be so harsh.[AN]
I just[Beat] It's what every parent fears,[N]
what I saw almost happen that day.[AN]
[Beat]I never wanted ye and Mish to leave,[N]
y'know. Me and yer mom argued about it[N]
for weeks when the two of ye told us.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Really? So[Beat] why did you let us[N]
go and join the Liberators, Dad?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Teresa[Beat] She convinced me, y'see.[N]
That ye kids weren't kids anymore,[N]
and that I shouldn't hold ye back.[AN]
She said that like how I found my[N]
purpose pit fightin', I should[N]
let ye two find your own purpose.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Mom said all that?[N]
I guess I should thank her.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I still worried, of course. That's[N]
why, when I came into this army,[N]
I was happy to see ye were alive.[AN]
Happy, but worried about ye.[N]
Ye were always headstrong, Tobie.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm sorry, Dad. You were right,[N]
though. I won't charge ahead anymore,[N]
not without you watching my back.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, I'm glad to hear it.[N]
When this war's over, I won't[N]
tell ye to come back home.[AN]
I know ye want to see the world,[N]
just like I did when I was a[N]
pit fighter. But, if you can[Beat][AN]
Yer mother would love seein'[N]
how ye've grown, Tobie.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Of course, Dad. I'll come home[N]
often and tell you two stories[N]
about all the places I've seen.[AN]
So let's both stay safe,[N]
until Decia is peaceful again![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadTakai][ThreeLineBox]
Y'know, I never though I'd be fightin'[N]
next to you, Shaw. Feels like it's[N]
been years since I saw you last.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The feeling's mutual, Takai.[N]
Fate's got a funny way of making itself[N]
known, if us two are on the same side.[AN]
I never thought I'd see you again[N]
after you stopped fighting for sport.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, life comes at ya fast, Shaw.[AN]
I had my kids to consider first,[N]
so I couldn't pend all my time[N]
fightin' and leave 'em without a dad.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's why I'll always be single, friend.[N]
I respect parents, but I've got no[N]
interest in being one myself.[AN]
It'd take me away from my true love[Beat][N]
the arena! Oh, how I miss it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha! Shaw, believe it or not, I feel[N]
the same. The rush of one-on-one[N]
combat, with no interruptions[Beat][AN]
Nothin' can top that. This army's[N]
nice n' all, but the fights here[N]
just aren't the same as back then.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Say, Takai. Do you remember[N]
how many wins we've each got[N]
against each other in the arena?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's been a long while, but before[N]
I left, it was[Beat] Fourty-nine each?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's right. Since we ran into each[N]
other again, what do you say we settle[N]
this for good between our battles?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That sounds like a grand idea, Shaw![AN]
First to fifty-one is the winner, aye?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, I'll agree to that.[N]
I hope you're still in top form,[N]
because I'm not going to hold back![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadTakai]
Oy, Shaw! Congrats on yer win,[N]
but don't go thinkin' that last[N]
bout is how it's gonna go next time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I sure hope it doesn't. Honestly,[N]
I knew that you were rusty,[N]
but it shouldn't have been that easy.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, it's been a long time since[N]
I had to fight someone as tough as you.[AN]
Most o' my jobs after quittin' the[N]
arena were takin' down bandits and[N]
the like, so I wasn't challenged.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh[Beat] Well, while you were off[N]
raising those kids of yours,[N]
I never stopped pit fighting.[AN]
If you were able to beat me straight[N]
out the gate, that would be a surprise.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Y'know Shaw, if ye've been fightin'[N]
all this time, where's all yer money?[AN]
I see ya scramblin' to get gold[N]
together whenever we're at the pub.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Some things just don't change, pal.[N]
Anyway, you ready for another round[N]
after this battle? I'm ready if you are.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ye, that's alright with me. I've been[N]
trainin' again like I used to, all for[N]
this rematch. Don't take me lightly![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it, Takai.[N]
You're far too strong for that![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadTakai]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well there, if it ain't Shaw![AN]
After all that smack ya talked,[N]
that last bout must've stung, eh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Where the hell were you hiding that[N]
kind of strength, Takai? You just[N]
about wiped the floor with me![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ya said it, right? I was just rusty.[N]
Needed a good fight to warm up.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Warm up, huh[Beat] You might even be[N]
stronger than you were before you[N]
quit. How did you improve so much?[AN]
[MidRight]
The strength o' a father, I guess?[N]
It's not like I sat around doin'[N]
nothin' for the last fifteen years.[AN]
I just needed a taste of a real fight.[N]
Gotta say, though[Beat] I miss this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Do you, now? This fight puts us at[N]
fifty wins and losses, and things[N]
are heating up with the Liberators.[AN]
I'm not sure we'll have the time[N]
to arrange one more bout, Takai.[AN]
And besides, if this is to be our[N]
last fight to prove who's strongest,[N]
we need a better stage than our base.[AN]
[MidRight]
What are ye getting at?[AN]
[MidLeft]
After we're done here, our last fight[N]
should take place at the Grand Oceanic[N]
Arena, the biggest stage out there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, that's that place bein' built[N]
in the Yuria Islands, right?[AN]
Looks like it's still a ways off.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is, but the arenamaster said it[N]
would be complete, soon enough.[AN]
[Beat]Five years. Let's meet there, five[N]
years after the Liberators disband,[N]
and settle which of us is stronger.[AN]
Barod said that the Yurian Cup would[N]
take place that day, the ultimate[N]
competition between arena fighters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Alright, Shaw. I'll be there,[N]
and I'll travel 'round the world[N]
to get back my pitfightin' moxie.[AN]
My kids are all grown up now, anyhow,[N]
and Teresa's always talkin' about us[N]
goin' on another honeymoon together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, just don't get distracted.[N]
I don't want to hear any excuses[N]
when you lose in the end, Takai![AN]
[MidRight]
Same to ya, Shaw![N]
May the best man win![A][X]
