Y'know, I never though I'd be fightin'[N]
next to you, Shaw. Feels like it's[N]
been years since I saw you last.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The feeling's mutual, Takai.[N]
Fate's got a funny way of making itself[N]
known, if us two are on the same side.[AN]
I never thought I'd see you again[N]
after you stopped fighting for sport.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, life comes at ya fast, Shaw.[AN]
I had my kids to consider first,[N]
so I couldn't pend all my time[N]
fightin' and leave 'em without a dad.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's why I'll always be single, friend.[N]
I respect parents, but I've got no[N]
interest in being one myself.[AN]
It'd take me away from my true love[Beat][N]
the arena! Oh, how I miss it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha! Shaw, believe it or not, I feel[N]
the same. The rush of one-on-one[N]
combat, with no interruptions[Beat][AN]
Nothin' can top that. This army's[N]
nice n' all, but the fights here[N]
just aren't the same as back then.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Say, Takai. Do you remember[N]
how many wins we've each got[N]
against each other in the arena?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's been a long while, but before[N]
I left, it was[Beat] Fourty-nine each?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's right. Since we ran into each[N]
other again, what do you say we settle[N]
this for good between our battles?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That sounds like a grand idea, Shaw![AN]
First to fifty-one is the winner, aye?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, I'll agree to that.[N]
I hope you're still in top form,[N]
because I'm not going to hold back![A][X]

Oy, Shaw! Congrats on yer win,[N]
but don't go thinkin' that last[N]
bout is how it's gonna go next time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I sure hope it doesn't. Honestly,[N]
I knew that you were rusty,[N]
but it shouldn't have been that easy.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, it's been a long time since[N]
I had to fight someone as tough as you.[AN]
Most o' my jobs after quittin' the[N]
arena were takin' down bandits and[N]
the like, so I wasn't challenged.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh[Beat] Well, while you were off[N]
raising those kids of yours,[N]
I never stopped pit fighting.[AN]
If you were able to beat me straight[N]
out the gate, that would be a surprise.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Y'know Shaw, if ye've been fightin'[N]
all this time, where's all yer money?[AN]
I see ya scramblin' to get gold[N]
together whenever we're at the pub.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Some things just don't change, pal.[N]
Anyway, you ready for another round[N]
after this battle? I'm ready if you are.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ye, that's alright with me. I've been[N]
trainin' again like I used to, all for[N]
this rematch. Don't take me lightly![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it, Takai.[N]
You're far too strong for that![A][X]

Well there, if it ain't Shaw![AN]
After all that smack ya talked,[N]
that last bout must've stung, eh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Where the hell were you hiding that[N]
kind of strength, Takai? You just[N]
about wiped the floor with me![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ya said it, right? I was just rusty.[N]
Needed a good fight to warm up.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Warm up, huh[Beat] You might even be[N]
stronger than you were before you[N]
quit. How did you improve so much?[AN]
[MidRight]
The strength o' a father, I guess?[N]
It's not like I sat around doin'[N]
nothin' for the last fifteen years.[AN]
I just needed a taste of a real fight.[N]
Gotta say, though[Beat] I miss this.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Do you, now? This fight puts us at[N]
fifty wins and losses, and things[N]
are heating up with the Liberators.[AN]
I'm not sure we'll have the time[N]
to arrange one more bout, Takai.[AN]
And besides, if this is to be our[N]
last fight to prove who's strongest,[N]
we need a better stage than our base.[AN]
[MidRight]
What are ye getting at?[AN]
[MidLeft]
After we're done here, our last fight[N]
should take place at the Grand Oceanic[N]
Arena, the biggest stage out there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, that's that place bein' built[N]
in the Yuria Islands, right?[AN]
Looks like it's still a ways off.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is, but the arenamaster said it[N]
would be complete, soon enough.[AN]
[Beat]Five years. Let's meet there, five[N]
years after the Liberators disband,[N]
and settle which of us is stronger.[AN]
Barod said that the Yurian Cup would[N]
take place that day, the ultimate[N]
competition between arena fighters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Alright, Shaw. I'll be there,[N]
and I'll travel 'round the world[N]
to get back my pitfightin' moxie.[AN]
My kids are all grown up now, anyhow,[N]
and Teresa's always talkin' about us[N]
goin' on another honeymoon together.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, just don't get distracted.[N]
I don't want to hear any excuses[N]
when you lose in the end, Takai![AN]
[MidRight]
Same to ya, Shaw![N]
May the best man win![A][X]
