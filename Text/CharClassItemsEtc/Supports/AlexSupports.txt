[OpenMidLeft]Axel! With me.[N]
Hi-ya![A]
[OpenMidRight]Woah! Nice strike, Alex.[N]
We're doing quite well today![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah! We'll show them we[N]
aren't dead weight at all.[AN]
Make the homeland proud and all.[N]
I'd say we're doing a good job.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah[Beat] it's been a lot of[N]
fighting, but we're still standing.[AN]
I'm sure we've done more than Cleo[N]
and Loewe ever expected.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Every time we're called upon[N]
we get it done.[AN]
We're model soldiers, aren't we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'd say.[N]
I'm just glad we get to fight together.[AN]
Which reminds me. I've been[N]
doing a bit of thinking.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thinking? Nothing good can[N]
come from that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't be cheeky![N]
I'm serious, Alex.[AN]
As twins, we have a bond unlike[N]
everyone else, well, except other twins.[AN]
It makes me wonder, can we do[N]
a special technique?[AN]
Something that will really cause[N]
tremors on the battlefield?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hmm[Beat] I hear you.[N]
I bet we can come up with something.[AN]
The ol' set-em-up-knock-em-down,[N]
or something like that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Maybe something that rolls off[N]
the tongue a little better.[AN]
Come on, let's think through this[N]
a bit more. It has to have a good name.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Even if we have a killer name, I know[N]
that we're still the strongest together.[AN]
Why, I know I feel better just fighting[N]
side by side with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Likewise. Wouldn't have it[N]
any other way.[AN]
Alright, scrap the name, let's just[N]
crack some skulls then, shall we?[A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hey there, pal! The commanders[N]
sent me over here to help[N]
rescue you if there was trouble,[AN]
but it looks like you're[N]
handlin' things just fine.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, a fight like this is nothin'![AN]
Me and my bro have seen worse[N]
tussles than this, let me tell you.[AN]
Still, I appreciate the thought.[N]
If you wanna help me take care[N]
of things, I'd appreciate it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sure, I don't mind. Anything that[N]
furthers Freyse's liberation[N]
is fine by me. Oh, I'm Faolan.[AN]
I guess I forgot that part.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I'm Alex. You mentioned Freyse,[N]
right? That's where I grew up, actually.[N]
Guess we've got something in common.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh, really? Well, I'm glad to have[N]
a compatriot fighting by my side.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]As am I. Anyway, let's get back[N]
to work, Faolan! These goons[N]
aren't gonna beat themselves![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You got it.[N]
We'll bring 'em down, together![A][X]

## AlexFaolanBSupport
[MidLeft][LoadFaolan]
[MidRight][LoadAlex][ThreeLineBox]
Say, Faolan. Those were some pretty[N]
smooth moves you pulled off,[N]
the last time we fought together.[AN]
You must have a lot of experience[N]
fighting in conflicts like these.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you could say that. I served[N]
as a militia man back in Freyse,[N]
before we were overrun by Cythes.[AN]
I learned quite a bit there,[N]
but not much was getting done.[AN]
Our forces were too small and not[N]
willing to take the fight to Cythes[N]
like the Liberators have been.[AN]
Still, I could say the same of you.[AN]
It's possible that you developed[N]
all these skills only recently,[N]
but when your rhythm is good,[AN]
it seems like no one can take you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Aw, I ain't that good, but you're[N]
not completely off-base. Me and my[N]
bro did our fair share of fighting,[AN]
long before we joined the Liberators.[AN]
We always faced professional soldiers,[N]
so we had to take advantage of our[N]
bond to defeat them and stay alive.[AN]
When one of us wasn't as focused,[N]
the other had to be in top form[Beat][N]
That was the goal of our style.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Interesting. If you don't mind me[N]
pryin', where did you gain that[N]
kinda experience, and how?[AN]
I'd like to keep it in mind[N]
for my own training, Alex.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er[Beat] Well, we grew up in the west side[N]
of Freyse's old capital, Peranth.[AN]
I'm not sure if you'd be able to[N]
replicate it in the countryside,[N]
like where you grew up.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Peranth, the seat of House Freyse[Beat][N]
Why would you say that?[AN]
Is it somethin' unique to a city?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat] Never mind, forget it.[N]
That's too long a story to[N]
tell on a battlefield like this.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That was strange. I've never seen[N]
Alex with such a solemn expression.[N]
S'pose everyone has a secret[Beat][A][X]

## AlexFaolanASupport
[MidLeft][LoadFaolan]
[MidRight][LoadAlex]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We're cuttin' through them pretty[N]
well, Alex. I guess that's the fruit[N]
of fighting side-by-side for so long.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm. You're almost as good at it as[N]
Axel, which is pretty impressive.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Maybe so, but I've got a long way to go.[N]
Without havin' experienced what you did,[N]
I might not ever reach your level.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Tell you what, Faolan. If you really[N]
want to know, I don't mind telling you,[N]
but you gotta keep it to yourself.[AN]
Me and my bro[Beat] weren't always on[N]
the right side of the law,[N]
so I can't have it going around.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Alright, I'll agree to that.[N]
You've got my word, Alex.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
So, Peranth[Beat] Despite how shoddy some[N]
areas of the city were, there were[N]
also some places glittering with gold.[AN]
Some of Joakim's loyalists were taking[N]
a bit too much in taxes compared to[N]
what they were supposed to in Freyse.[AN]
The outer reaches were less effected,[N]
I hear, but Peranth was a real cesspit.[AN]
Since we and our families were affected,[N]
me and my bro wanted to do something.[AN]
To that end, we joined the Jackal Gang,[N]
whose goal was to take from the rich[N]
and give to the poor. A common story, eh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yeah, in bedtime stories.[N]
Ah, sorry, didn't mean[N]
to interrupt. Please, keep goin'.[AN]
[MidRight]
Right. Anyway, with the leadership[N]
of a fellow named Kjell, we threw[N]
the nobles into a right panic![AN]
We'd break into their homes at night[N]
and take whatever we could grab,[N]
fighting our way through their guards.[AN]
Things were going good, and we[N]
became local heroes to the poor[N]
and downtrodden in Peranth.[AN]
But then, our leader disappeared,[N]
and everything fell apart from there.[AN]
Me and my bro left town to escape the[N]
fallout, and eventually, we made[N]
our way to join the Liberators.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see[Beat] So facin' foes dramatically[N]
stronger than you and livin' to tell[N]
the tale refined the two of you,[AN]
and heightened your synergy?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, you could say that.[N]
[Beat]But I'm tired of all that, now.[N]
I feel like I've lost my purpose.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]How about joinin' the militia, then?[AN]
Freyse will no doubt need a hand[N]
when all's said and done, so is the[N]
job of the Jackal Gang truly done?[AN]
Would Kjell have wanted you to quit[N]
while so many Freysians still suffer?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Heh. Talking me into one last job,[N]
huh? Fine, Faolan. I'm on board.[N]
I'm expecting you to carry, though![A][X]

Hey there![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, hi![A][N]
You're not with the[N]
government, are you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What?[A][N]
Uh, we were rebelling[N]
against Duke Cidor until[N]
recently, so I guess not?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Eh, good enough.[A][N]
My name's Mantou. I'm a new[N]
recruit to the Decian Liberators.[A][N]
Just a totally normal[N]
humble rancher, yup.[A]
[MidLeft]
Good to have you, buddy![A][N]
You look a pretty strong sort.[A][N]
Not many of the Liberators[N]
can keep up with me,[A][N]
but maybe you'll count[N]
among those few who can.[A]
[MidRight]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove](Hah! Worked like a charm.)[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Hey Alex, how strong do[N]
you think you are anyway?[A]
[MidLeft]
Tougher than most nails,[N]
if that's what you're asking.[A][N]
Ol' Xlea's the only guy I've[N]
ever known who could outlift me,[A][N]
and he's probably dead by now.[A]
[MidRight]
Want to see if I[N]
can measure up?[A]
[MidLeft]
Sure.[A][N]
Once we're out of the battle,[N]
meet me in the training yard.[A][N]
I challenge you to[N]
a contest of strength![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I accept![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
See you then,[N]
Mantou, buddy![A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Heh.[A][N]
That'll be the[N]
perfect distraction for[N]
me to rob her blind[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]And for my first[N]
display, how about this?[A][N]
I'll lift this battle[N]
axe with one hand![A][N]
Think you can match that strength?[A]
[MidRight]
Not bad. But here,[N]
check this out![A][N]
I'll lift TWO battle axes![A]
[MidLeft]
That's with one hand each,[N]
but it's still impressive.[A][N]
And I'm about to do something[N]
even cooler than that.[A][N]
I'll take the axe, and cut down[N]
this tree in a single hack![A]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight]
And I'll throw this barrel[N]
high enough to hit a pegasus![A][N]
Hyah![A]

I'm lucky that was a near miss.[AN]
Enemy siege fire coming from[N]
behind our lines[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh, uhh, nothing to worry about![A][N]
We already dealt with[N]
the enemy ballistician.[A]
[FarRight]
Very well. Thank you, Axel.[N]
Let us return to battle![A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]That was an accident, all righ-[A][N]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Watch this![A][N]
You can throw a single barrel,[N]
but I'll throw two barrels at once![A][N]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Wait, we don't have[N]
any more barrels.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'll go get some.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It's probably good that[N]
she left. I don't think I can[N]
actually carry both barrels.[A][N]
Maybe I'll use this[N]
chance to train[Beat][A][X]

This is a robbery![A][N]
Put your hands up and[N]

Stand back, bandit![N]

Oh, it's just you. What[N]
the heck are you doing?[A]
[MidRight]
I was just, uhh, practicing[N]
it as a battle cry to[N]
scare away our enemies.[A][N]
I'd never throw a barrel[N]
at my friend, all right?[A]

Throw a barrel[Beat] Ever since our[N]
last test of strength, Mantou,[A][N]
I've been practicing the[N]
fabled two-barrel throw,[A][N]
all for this glorious moment![A][N]
Hand that over, and[N]
watch[A] and[A] learn!!![A]

Wait, you were actually[N]
