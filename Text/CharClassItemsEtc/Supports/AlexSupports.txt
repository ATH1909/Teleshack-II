Hey there![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, hi![A][N]
You're not with the[N]
government, are you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What?[A][N]
Uh, we were rebelling[N]
against Duke Cidor until[N]
recently, so I guess not?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Eh, good enough.[A][N]
My name's Mantou. I'm a new[N]
recruit to the Decian Liberators.[A][N]
Just a totally normal[N]
humble rancher, yup.[A]
[MidLeft]
Good to have you, buddy![A][N]
You look a pretty strong sort.[A][N]
Not many of the Liberators[N]
can keep up with me,[A][N] 
but maybe you'll count[N]
among those few who can.[A]
[MidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Hah! Worked like a charm.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Hey Alex, how strong do[N]
you think you are anyway?[A]
[MidLeft]
Tougher than most nails,[N]
if that's what you're asking.[A][N]
Ol' Xlea's the only guy I've[N]
ever known who could outlift me,[A][N]
and he's probably dead by now.[A]
[MidRight]
Want to see if I[N]
can measure up?[A]
[MidLeft]
Sure.[A][N]
Once we're out of the battle,[N]
meet me in the training yard.[A][N]
I challenge you to[N]
a contest of strength![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I accept![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
See you then,[N]
Mantou, buddy![A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Heh.[A][N]
That'll be the[N]
perfect distraction for[N]
me to rob her blind[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]And for my first[N]
display, how about this?[A][N]
I'll lift this battle[N]
axe with one hand![A][N]
Think you can match that strength?[A]
[MidRight]
Not bad. But here,[N]
check this out![A][N]
I'll lift TWO battle axes![A]
[MidLeft]
That's with one hand each,[N]
but it's still impressive.[A][N]
And I'm about to do something[N]
even cooler than that.[A][N]
I'll take the axe, and cut down[N]
this tree in a single hack![A]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight]
And I'll throw this barrel[N]
high enough to hit a pegasus![A][N]
Hyah![A]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]

[FarRight]
I'm lucky that was a near miss.[AN]
Enemy siege fire coming from[N]
behind our lines[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh, uhh, nothing to worry about![A][N]
We already dealt with[N]
the enemy ballistician.[A]
[FarRight]
Very well. Thank you, Axel.[N]
Let us return to battle![A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]That was an accident, all righ-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Watch this![A][N]
You can throw a single barrel,[N]
but I'll throw two barrels at once![A]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Wait, we don't have[N]
any more barrels.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'll go get some.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It's probably good that[N]
she left. I don't think I can[N]
actually carry both barrels.[A][N]
Maybe I'll use this[N]
chance to train[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft]
Oh hey, Mantou. So[N]
about the barrels thing-[A]
[FarFarRight]
A lone target[Beat][N]
This'll be easy.[A]
[MidRight][LoadMantou]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
This is a robbery![A][N]
Put your hands up and[N]
give me all your money,[N]
or I'll throw a barrel at you.[A]
[MidLeft]
Stand back, bandit![N]
I will never yield to-[A][N]
Oh, it's just you. What[N]
the heck are you doing?[A]
[MidRight]
I was just, uhh, practicing[N]
it as a battle cry to[N]
scare away our enemies.[A][N]
I'd never throw a barrel[N]
at my friend, all right?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Throw a barrel[Beat] Ever since our[N]
last test of strength, Mantou,[A][N]
I've been practicing the[N]
fabled two-barrel throw,[A][N]
all for this glorious moment![A][N]
Hand that over, and[N]
watch[A] and[A] learn!!![A]
[MidRight]
Wait, you were actually[N]
serious about that?[A][N]
Nobody can hold two[N]
barrels at once![A]
[MidLeft]
One like this,[N]
the other like this[Beat][A][N]
and[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
 HYAH![A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[FarFarRight]
Gaaah! What the heck[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh, sorry, buddy. I[N]
didn't mean to hit you.[A][N]
But to be fair,[A][N]
you were trying to throw a[N]
barrel at me first, right?[A]
[FarFarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]ow[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll go get a healer.[A][X]
