Oh[Beat] What a terrible, terrible day.[N]
The enemies are quite a challenge[Beat][N]
But it seems my allies fare well today![AN]
Perhaps they wouldn't mind if I were[N]
to hang back here and wait[Beat][N]
Er, to protect their rear, of course.[AN]
Yes, that sounds like a fine idea![N]
I think I'll do just that.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadTippany]
U-Um, excuse me, sir knight?[N]
I saw you come here from the frontlines,[N]
with a ghastly expression on your face.[AN]
Do you happen to be injured anywhere?[N]
I can heal what ails you before you[N]
return to the front, if you like.[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
By Byelen, could you warn a man before[N]
you sneak up on his person? I thought[N]
you were one of our enemies, child![AN]
[MidRight]
O-Oh, my apologies.[N]
I only meant to help,[N]
but[Beat][CloseEyes] if I'm not needed[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Now, now. No need for such a dour[N]
expression, you merely alarmed me.[AN]
Hm[Beat] Say, I don't recognize you.[N]
Are you a new recruit around here?[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Ah, yes! My name is Tippany.[N]
It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir Meldan![AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, well met[Beat] Wait a moment.[N]
That garb, and that name[Beat][AN]
Oh, no. Er[Beat] I appreciate your offer[N]
to heal my wounds, but I really must go![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveFarLeft][.4][MoveFarFarLeft][FarFarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
H-Huh? Wait a moment, Sir Meldan.[AN]
It's not safe to go back injured![N]
Please, let me heal you first![AN][MoveFarFarLeft][X]

Huff[Beat] Huff[Beat] Have I finally[N]
escaped her sight? Oh, Helman![AN]
If I had known repaying my debt[N]
would earn me a cultist's scorn,[N]
I never would've joined the Liberators![AN]
Avoiding this fiend both in the base[N]
and on the battlefield takes a toll.[N]
If I wait here much longer, she'll-[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadTippany][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
Please[Beat] Please stop fleeing, sir![N]
You'll injure yourself, going this fast.[N]
I'm nearly out of breath, myself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And yet, you keep chasing! How is it[N]
that you can move so fast and far,[N]
in such heavy robes and garb?![AN]
As I thought, it can only be witchcraft![AN]
[MidRight]
W-What? I'm just a simple mage, honest![N]
I know my dark magic may look scary,[N]
but it's really not that uncommon.[AN]
It's true that it descends from Cherne,[N]
but many dark mages today are wholly[N]
non-religious, or even Byelen adherents![AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, but you are neither! Do you think[N]
I don't know your true nature, Tippany?[AN]
You may be able to fool the others,[N]
but I'm a well-traveled man, you know.[AN]
One of the most fearsome things I've[N]
seen in my travels was a group of[N]
Decians who spurned Byelen's light[Beat][AN]
They followed the old ways of Cherne.[AN]
And you[Beat] Well, you weren't important,[N]
but I remember seeing your face while[N]
I fled as fast as my steed could gallop![AN]
Had I been a second slower, would[N]
you not have sacrificed me to Cherne?![AN]
[MidRight]
I-I-I don't know what you're talking[N]
about! I[Beat] I never meant to[Beat][N]
I only wanted to help people![AN]
The rest are all gone now, anyway[Beat][N]
I'm the only one who survived.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph[Beat] The rest can think as they like,[N]
but I will not fall for your lies![N]
Stay away from me, or[Beat] or else![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat]I should've known that people would[N]
find out, sooner or later. If Meldan[N]
tells the others, then will I[Beat][AN]
Will I even have a place here anymore?[A][X]

[MidRight]
And[Beat] there! That should be enough[N]
for you to get back to the fight.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thanks for the healing, Miss Tippany.[N]
I feel right as rain after that![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm glad to hear it, but please,[N]
be a bit more careful. It wouldn't[N]
do for you to get injured again.[AN]

O-Of course! Well, I'm off.[N]
Wish me luck, Miss Tippany![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

Hm? Is someone there? If you need[N]
healing, please don't hesitate to ask.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
[Beat]No, I'm quite fine, Tippany.[N]
I came here to check on you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, Sir Meldan. It[Beat] It's been a while[N]
since we last spoke, hasn't it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, it has[Beat] I see that you haven't[N]
been up to any of your old tricks.[AN]
No matter who I speak to, or how[N]
long I watch your actions, I cannot[N]
find even a hint of misconduct.[AN]
Frankly, I am[Beat] perplexed.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Is that so? I cannot blame you for[N]
your fears, but is it so hard to[N]
believe that I truly want to change?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Even if you do, you can only change[N]
what you are. What you were[Beat][N]
That will never wash away.[AN]
No matter how influenced you were[N]
by the other members of the cult,[N]
your hands are your own, are they not?[AN]
You cannot blame others for your sin.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I know that better than anyone.[AN]
If you wish to bring me to justice,[N]
then I'm willing to accept that.[AN]
Please[Beat] just wait until after[N]
this war. There are people that[N]
need my help, now more than ever.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Very well. When all is over,[N]
you should turn yourself in.[N]
Confess your crimes, honestly.[AN]
[Beat]I know the feeling of guilt,[N]
the feeling of not being enough,[N]
so take it from me, Tippany.[AN]
You'll feel better if you confront[N]
it head on and atone for your[N]
actions with an unburdened heart.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yes, I truly hope so, Sir Meldan.[AN]
When my sentence is up, I'm not sure[N]
where I'll go, or what I'll do[Beat][N]
Do you think that we'll meet again?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm[Beat] Who can say where the winds[N]
will blow? But if we do, then[Beat][N]
I hope we meet as friends.[A][X]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
And who might you be?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Name's Volran, a traveling explorer.[N]
Newest member of this band, I guess.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]It's a pleasure to[N]
meet you, Volran.[A][N]
I am Sir Meldan of Freyse.[A]
[MidRight]
You're a knight, huh? Cool![A][N]
I've been reading an awful[N]
lot about knights lately.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I discovered this book[N]
called the Epic of Shaobing[N]
at a library in Chouwouj.[A][N]
It's all about knights and[N]
adventures and stuff.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ah, the founding myth[N]
of the kingdom of Chouwouj![A][N]
[CloseEyes]So few Decians appreciate mythology[N]
from cultures not their own[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]It's good to find a friend with[N]
the same literary taste as I.[A][N]
What do you think of the[N]
Epic so far, Volran?[A]
[MidRight]
It's really good![A][N]
I love the stories of[N]
big battles in particular.[A][N]
I don't quite understand all of[N]
the fancy words it uses, though.[A][N]
Or the romance parts.[A]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes]I've reread the Epic many times.[A][N]
In truth, it was what inspired me[N]
to become a knight as a youth.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]How far along are you in it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm at the part where Shaobing[N]
fights this giant dragon thingy[N]
that rules in[Beat] some mountains?[A][N]
I don't remember if it[N]
said the name anywhere.[A]
[MidLeft]
The great battle with[N]
Guolong the Ashen Serpent[AN]
is one of my favorite passages[N]
of the Epic of Shaobing as well.[A][N]
Thank you for this most[N]
enlightening conversation, Volran.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You're welcome![A][N]
If I have any questions about[N]
the story, I'll definitely ask you.[A][X]

## MeldanVolranB
[MidLeft][LoadMeldan][MidRight][LoadVolran]
[MidRight]
Oh hi, Meldan.[A][N]
I was reading more of[N]
the Epic of Shaobing,[A][N]
but I got to a part that[N]
I'm kinda confused about.[A]
[MidLeft]
I'd be happy to help.[N]
What is your question, exactly?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
So I'm at the chapter where[N]
Shaobing's evil uncle guy[N]
tries to steal her throne,[A][N]
and she goes to find the[N]
bow Daybreak to defeat him.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
When the uncle's soldiers[N]
try to chase after her,[A][N]
some knight lady stays behind[N]
to fight them off while[N]
she goes into the cave.[A][N]
Who is that?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]You don't know who[N]
Dhebra the Raven's Beak was?[A][N]
She was the warrior-queen[N]
Shaobing's greatest general,[A][N]
and plays a prominent role in the plot[N]
as her close friend since childhood.[A][N]
Her sacrifice protecting her liege[N]
is a legendary tale of chivalry.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, cool. She was never[N]
mentioned before now.[A]
[MidLeft]
Never mentioned[Beat]?[A][N]
What about her great speech[N]
at Shaobing's coronation?[A][N]
How do you possibly read the[N]
Epic without seeing Dhebra?[A]
[MidRight]
Look, I don't know.[A][N]
She just kinda[Beat] never[N]
came up anywhere, all right?[A][N]
Here, take a look at[N]
my copy of the book.[A]
[MidRight][MoveLeft]
[Left][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft]
These[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]are these drawings?[A][N]
Is this some sort[N]
of[Beat] children's version?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Is it?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It appears so.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]The translation of the prose and[N]
dialogue is[Beat] utterly butchered.[A][N]
This can hardly be called an[N]
actual copy of the Epic of Shaobing.[A][OpenEyes]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Oh.[A][N]
It was all I could find[N]
at the library, so, uh[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I thought I had found a[N]
kindred spirit in you, Volran.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I suppose I was mistaken.[A]
[MidLeft]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
[CloseEyes]So if this isn't even the[N]
real version of the story[Beat][A][N]
then what is[Beat]?[A][X]

## MeldanVolranA
[MidLeft][LoadMeldan][MidRight][LoadVolran]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Volran[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I wish to apologize for[N]
what I said to you earlier.[A]
[MidRight]
What's that you're holding?[N]
It looks like an old book.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[OpenEyes]I should not have been so[Beat] harsh[N]
on you for reading an inferior[N]
version of the Epic of Shaobing,[A][N]
when you didn't even have[N]
access to a correct one.[A][N]
As such, I have brought you[N]
my personal copy of the text.[A][N]
More specifically, this is[N]
Vinny von Theodosian's[N]
translation into modern Decian.[A][N]
It's rather worn, I'm afraid,[N]
but I hope it will suffice.[A]
[MidLeft][MoveRight]
[Right][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Wow. This is[Beat][N]
really thoughtful of you.[A][N]
Thanks, Meldan![A]
[MidLeft]
It was my pleasure.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]What the heck are[N]
all of these fancy words?[A][N]
They're so complicated,[N]
I can hardly read them.[A][N]
What the heck does [OpenQuote]atheling" mean?[A]
[MidLeft]
A person of noble blood in[N]
the founding days of Chouwouj.[A]
[MidRight]
Cool.[A][N]
There are a bunch of other weird[N]
old words like that, though.[A][N]
And some of the letters[N]
are ones I've never seen![A][N]
My [OpenQuote]inferior" version was[N]
so much easier to read.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That children's version of[N]
the Epic was, well, intended[N]
for teaching to children.[A][N]
And you said you struggled[N]
with it, did you not?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you sure you[N]
know how to read, Volran?[A]
[MidRight]
Well[Beat][A] honestly[Beat][AN]
uh[Beat][A] [CloseEyes]not really.[AN]
I never got the chance[N]
to learn to read as a kid.[A][N]
I only started to[N]
pick it up recently,[A][N]
and that was mostly just[N]
because I needed it for magic.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But then I found the Epic[N]
of Shaobing at that library,[N]
sorted in with some tomes.[A][N]
I picked it up by accident at[N]
first, but fell in love with it.[A][N]
It's way cooler than the simpler[N]
stories I was told as a child.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I see.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I'm so, so sorry for[N]
mocking you earlier, Volran,[A][N]
for simply doing the best[N]
you could with what you had.[A][N]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][OpenEyes]Hey, do you think you could[N]
try teaching me how to read[N]
the real version of the Epic?[A][N]
Maybe that would even[N]
make magic easier too.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[OpenEyes]I know little of magic.[A][N]
But reading for its own sake looks[N]
to be a true passion of yours, Volran.[A][N]
I'd be happy to help that[N]
passion grow and blossom.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Sure. I think I'd be[N]
interested in that, Meldan.[A][N]
As soon as all of this is over,[N]
I'll come meet you in Decia,[A][N]
and we'll go over the entirety[N]
of the Epic of Shaobing.[A][N]
Correctly, this time.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, indeed.[A][N]
It will be a pleasure to teach[N]
a young man like you, Volran.[A][X]
