## Zwieback_Ellerey_C

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Well, another armored soldier.[N]
Looks like we're in luck![N]
Call me Zwieback, kid.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]I am Ellerey.[N]
It's nice to meet you, Zwieback.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]The pleasure's all mine, kid.[N]
You youngsters getting involved in war[Beat][AN]
It takes guts to do what you do.[N]
You know that, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm just trying to do my best.[N]
I'm on a mission.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What sort of mission[N]
is that, Ellerey?[A]
[OpenMidRight]To become a great blacksmith.[N]
A master of the forge.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]A noble goal indeed.[N]
Are you looking for some practice?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]It's been a while since I've forged.[N]
Building tools for war is easier than[N]
fighting in them, it would appear.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Indeed. You know, forget it.[N]
We've got enough going on.[N]
I shouldn't prattle on about my ideas.[A][X]

## Zwieback_Ellerey_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[OpenMidRight]Zwieback, just what was it[N]
you were thinking of for a forge?[AN]
Custom made items are quite popular.[N]
A lot of people go crazy for them.[AN]
You can fetch quite a price in[N]
the market if the smith is famous.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're a sweet old thing, Ellerey.[N]
But I don't wanna trouble you.[AN]
Not during the heat of the war and all that.[N]
Maybe when we're done.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I've never forged a custom bow.[AN]
If there is a forge[N]
and we can get materials[Beat][AN]
I will make something for you.[N]
[OpenMidLeft]You can forge bows?[N]
I thought you needed to be a bowyer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I've made a few standard issue[N]
iron bows in my day.[AN]
But never anything more complex.[N]
It's a bit tricky, getting the curves right.[AN]
I'd be happy to make something for you.[N]
Honest![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Let me think through what I want.[AN]
I can share the requirements with you later[N]
and we can sort it out from there, yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Works for me.[N] 
I look forward to it.[A][X]

## Zwieback_Ellerey_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadZwieback][OpenMidRight][LoadEllerey]
[OpenMidLeft]Ellerey! There you are.[N]
Here's my list of requirements.[AN]
I'm thinking this will be something[N]
real helpful for me.[AN]
You know, being an armored bowman.[N]
Not many folks don both armor and bow![A]
[OpenMidRight]Excellent, let's see[Beat][N]
Oh, this is interesting.[AN]
A bow made of a lightweight metal.[N]
That seems doable.[AN]
Can shoot great distances,[N] 
but also up close.[AN]
A bow that fires up close?[N]
I don't think that can be done.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know it's a tall order,[N]
but imagine if you made one?[AN]
I'm always on the frontlines,[N]
but can't hit enemies in front of me.[AN]
I've gotta lob it over folks' heads[N]
or take a step back.[AN]
Frankly, it's a bit daft how[N]
I get used on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You don't trust Cleo and Loewe[N]
to ensure archers are safe?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]War is chaotic, Ellerey.[N]
There's no telling what will happen.[AN]
Why do you think I wear this armor?[N]
Too many times I've taken a hit.[AN]
Whether by my own volition or the[N]
gaffes of a tactician,[AN]
we bow fighters see the frontlines[N]
quite a bit more than you'd expect.[AN]
That's why I want a bow that can[N]
fire at short range.[AN]
For protection.[N]
You get me, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I just[Beat] don't know if it can be done.[N]
There are also ethics to consider.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ethics?[N]
What's unethical about making a bow?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You see, sword smiths are a funny bunch.[N]
They're particular about what goes to market.[AN]
They haven't figured out how[N]
to make a throwing blade or[N]
anything that can attack far.[AN]
Thus, they want to keep a[N]
monopoly on close range.[AN]
If we went to market with a bow that was[N]
adept at bow close and long range[Beat][AN]
We'd become targets. They'd try to scare us[N]
into leaving town and our bows behind.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Like they're doing to you right now?[AN]
I don't know much about business,[N]
but if you can't make it, just say so.[AN]
Ellerey[Beat][N]
I'm sorry for troubling you.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
It's not that, it's just[Beat][N]
Never mind.[AN]
You're right.[N]
I shouldn't give into fear.[AN]
This is a custom bow.[N]
A gift for a friend.[AN]
Not soemthing for commercial consumption.[N]
It won't go to market as a sword slayer.[AN]
It's a gift for my good friend.[N]
A friend I'm glad to have.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Shucks, Ellerey, that's nice and all.[N]
I really appreciate your kindness.[A][X]
