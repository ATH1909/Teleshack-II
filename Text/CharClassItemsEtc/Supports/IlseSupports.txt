[MidLeft][LoadIlse][MidRight][LoadOjasvi]
Is that[Beat] Could it be[Beat]?[N]
Pardon me, but are you of Mahemen?[AN]
You dress like the Byelen faithful[N]
from my homeland.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed I am, child.[N]
You may call me Ilse.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sister Ilse, I've been living in exile[N]
for a time[Beat] and I've received no[N]
word from my family at home.[AN]
By chance, have you heard of the fates[N]
of any of the Srivastana family?[N]
I've been unable to locate them.[A]
[MidLeft][Beat] Srivastana family?[N]
[Beat] No, I'm afraid I've not heard[N]
news of them, miss.[AN]
I was in Wustheim and was captured.[N]
I still do not know the fates of[N]
my own family or friends.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]Oh[Beat] I'm so sorry.[N]
I've been selfish.[AN]
In my grief I only focused on myself.[N]
Too rude to even introduce myself properly.[AN]
I am Ojasvi.[N]
Please forgive me, Sister Ilse.[A]
[MidLeft]You are most kind, child.[N]
Now that we are with this army,[AN]
let's see if we can uncover[N]
any news of those we love, hm?[A]
[MidRight]Yes, thank you.[A][X]

## Ilse_Ojasvi_B

[MidLeft][LoadIlse][MidRight][LoadOjasvi]
Sister Ilse, how are you faring?[N]
Have you any news?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]None, I'm afraid.[N]
It appears even after repeling[N]
the Cytheans from our borders,[AN]
that those scattered have yet to return.[N]
It makes me think the worst has befallen[N]
them, sad as it may be.[A]
[MidRight]I've sent letter after letter.[N]
Writing to my family, even my cousins[N]
with whom I've grown distant,[AN]
but none have replied me.[N]
I'm losing sleep not knowing[N]
their fates. I feel[Beat] powerless.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]I am sure that if they fell,[N]
they fought valiantly to the end.[A]
[MidRight]You think their valiance and valor[N]
would make up for their death?[AN]
As though they're an ancient heroes[N]
featured in an epic lament!?[AN]
I refuse to accept they've perished![N]
They are still out there![AN]
I thought you Byelen Faithful[N]
spoke of hope and salvation.[AN]
Perhaps I misjudged you.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]

## Ilse_Ojasvi_A

[MidLeft][LoadIlse][MidRight][LoadOjasvi]
[MidLeft]Ojasvi, I wanted to apologize[N]
for upsetting you earlier.[AN]
[MidRight][Beat] It's alright.[N]
I had a bad outburst.[AN]
It was childish of me.[N]
I just[Beat] hate not knowing their fates[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Perhaps then, my news may ease you.[N]
I was able to find my sisters.[N]
Scattered across Mahemen, they were.[AN]
However, I only share this detail with you[N]
because of who they claimed to meet.[AN]
It seems they crossed paths with[N]
your father.[A]
[MidRight]My father?![N]
So, he lives after all.[N][CloseEyes]
I feel so suddenly at ease.[AN][OpenEyes]
Tell me, Sister Ilse, where is he?[N]
I would like to write him immediately[N]
to let him know of my whereabouts.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]Please allow me to finish.[A]
[MidRight][Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]My friend was stationed in[N]
a farming village outside Wustheim.[N]
She escaped the worst of the attack.[AN]
She gathered survivors into the church,[N]
and tended to their wounds.[N]
It was there she met your father.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]Are you certain it was him?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]This letter is signed with the[N]
name Harshdip Srivastana.[AN]
Does the penmanship look familiar to you?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]Yes[Beat] there is no doubt.[N]
This is my father's handwriting.[N]
But it looks[Beat] so jittery.[AN]
As though the grip of his quill[N]
was weakened, as though the life was[N]
leaving him with every stroke[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]It's addressed to me.[N]
But[Beat] how did he know to write me?[A]
[MidLeft]My friend shared that this man[N]
had a daughter studying abroad.[AN]
He hoped he could write her a letter,[N]
in hopes that somehow it may reach her.[AN]
My friend also shared[Beat] that[N]
your father passed on shortly after.[AN]
His injuries from the battle were[N]
too grievous to overcome.[AN]
Ojasvi, I am sorry to be the[N]
one to share this news.[A]
[MidRight]Sister Ilse[Beat] you went far out[N]
of your way to learn of my father.[AN]
Even after my poor behavior,[N]
you searched for me[Beat][AN]
I owe you a great debt for this letter.[N]
For it's a miracle it made its way to me.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]Will you not read it?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]Yes, but I should like to read[N]
it alone, for I am sure I will yet grieve.[AN]
I would not want you to see me[N]
in the aftermath of this.[AN]
It's[Beat] quite a lengthy[N]
read as well.[A]
[MidLeft]Very well, Ojasvi.[N]
You must do as you see fit.[AN]
Remember[Beat] we are in this together.[N]
When you are ready and wish to speak,[AN]
come find me. I will lend you my ear.[A]
[MidRight]Sister Ilse[Beat] thank you.[A][X]
