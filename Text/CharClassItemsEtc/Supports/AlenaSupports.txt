Filone, open your eyes![A]
[MidRight]
H-Huh? Who is it?![A]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you, asleep?[N]
It's me, Alena.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
O-Oh, Miss Alena. No,[N]
I wasn't sleepin', honest![AN]
I just[Beat][CloseEyes] lost focus[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You're doing it again,[N]
so that's not very convincing.[AN]
Did you stay up late?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Only a little! I was doin' some extra[N]
trainin', to catch up to everyone.[AN]
I know I ain't worth much, not like[N]
you, but I don't wanna be a burden.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But you were, just now. If someone[N]
had snuck up while you were out of it,[N]
I would've had to cut them down.[AN]
That's more of a burden than[N]
just doing what you always do.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Sorry, Miss Alena.[N]
I won't do it again.[AN]
It's just[Beat] my pa always tells me[N]
the same thing, to be careful,[N]
but I can't stay like I am now.[AN]
I wanna become strong, like you,[N]
so I can protect everyone else![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
You think I'm strong?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah! Your sword goes all[Beat] swoosh![AN]
It's so fast, I can hardly see it.[N]
Wish I could do that with my bow![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Look, if you want to get stronger[N]
that bad, then training more is good.[AN]
That being said, you can't let it[N]
worsen your focus. Talk to me the[N]
next time you train outside of drills.[AN]
I'll make sure you don't overwork[N]
yourself and show you some tricks,[N]
if you're that curious about them.[AN]
[MidRight]
Really? Alright, that sounds awesome![N]
Thanks, Miss Alena. You won't regret it![AN][X]

Hey, hey![N]
Miss Alena![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, Filone. You seem more energetic[N]
lately, so you must not be doing[N]
any extra extra training, right?[AN]
[MidRight]
O-Of course not! Your regimen's[N]
got me so exhausted by the end[N]
that I crawl in my bunk and lay there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! That just means it's working.[AN]
Well, you don't want that fatigue[N]
to carry over to the battlefield,[N]
but it's a good kind of pain.[AN]
It means you're getting stronger.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, it used to be hard for me[N]
to do much of anythin' against[N]
someone in a one-on-one fight.[AN]
With your exercises though,[N]
my arrows pack a real punch now![AN]
[MidLeft]
That's good. Self-reliance is[N]
an important trait, Filone.[AN]
It separates the weak from the strong.[N]
We have capable allies, no doubt,[N]
but you can't count on them alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Sorry if I'm pryin', Miss Alena,[N]
but are you speakin' from experience?[AN]
Your eyes look[Beat] lonely, I guess.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] You can see right through me,[N]
huh? Yeah, your intuition is right.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Do you[Beat] wanna talk about it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, not really.[A] I appreciate it,[N]
but it's a long story and not[N]
particularly unique, I'm afraid.[AN]
Just one more orphan on the street[N]
with only a knife in her hand[Beat][AN]
Ah, there I go telling it, huh?[N]
Sorry, Filone. Let's get back[N]
to the battle for now, alright?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Miss Alena[Beat] You've helped me so[N]
much, so I can't just ignore this.[AN]
Sorry, but I'm helpin' you,[N]
whether you want it or not![AN][X]

Miss Alena, do you have a second?[N]
I wanted to talk about somethin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What's with the formalities, Filone?[N]
I think we know each other well enough[N]
that you can drop that [OpenQuote]Miss" thing.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, then[Beat] Alena, I wanted to thank[N]
you for everythin' you've done for me.[AN]
I feel like I'm not a burden anymore[Beat][N]
Though I still have a ways to go[N]
before I'm as strong as the others.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No need to be down on yourself,[N]
Filone. You've long since reached[N]
my level, if not surpassed it.[AN]
I doubt you need to train with me[N]
anymore, since you've come this far.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's[Beat] Maybe, but I want[N]
to keep practicin' with you![AN]
Honestly, I wasn't close to many[N]
people besides my dad before I joined[N]
the Liberators, but things have changed.[AN]
I've made a bunch of friends here![AN]
Heck, some of them are like family now.[N]
And Pa always says that you help family,[N]
no matter what, so[Beat] I wanna help you![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] appreciate the sentiment,[N]
but [OpenQuote]help" me? With what, exactly?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's about that story you mentioned.[AN]
You said you didn't want to talk about[N]
it, but it seemed to me like you[N]
wanted to get it off your chest.[AN]
Maybe I'm wrong, but[Beat][N]
I'm pretty sure I'm not.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]The battlefield is no place for this,[N]
Filone. Have you learned nothing from[N]
my lessons? Maintain your focus, always.[AN]
Otherwise, you'll find a knife in your[N]
back quicker than you can blink.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes][OneLineBox]
But[Beat] I only wanted to help[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Don't cry, alright? I can tell you[N]
a bit, but not here in mid-combat.[AN]
When we get back to camp,[N]
I'll tell you everything.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes][OneLineBox]
O-Oh! Okay![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]One more thing, Filone.[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-Yes?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You[Beat] No, never mind.[N]
Just stay safe, Filone.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Right![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You're like family to me, too.[AN]
I never thought I'd say that again[N]
after losing one before, but life[N]
has a way of throwing out surprises.[AN]
I'll make sure we both make it through[N]
this and live to see peaceful days[Beat][A][X]
