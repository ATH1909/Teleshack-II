[OpenMidRight]
Hey! Horse lady![N]
Help me out, over here![AN]
You're a healer, right?[N]
Well, heal me! Please![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh! Um, yes. Allow me.[N]
Are you alright?[AN]
You don't look too badly bruised.[N]
Heal staves are expensive, you know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You pay for your own heal[N]
staves in the army?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, usually we steal[N]
them from our enemies, but-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
That's unacceptable.[N]
But you said they're expensive, right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Expensive is a relative term,[N]
but I suppose it's no plate of[N]
rice and beans, if that's what you mean.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, anyway, I think I'm all healed[N]
up now. Thanks again for lending a hand.[N]
I'm Mantou, I'll see you later.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm[Beat] Leina.[N]
Well, that was abrupt.[N]
They really will let anyone fight with us, huh?[AN]
I suppose I shouldn't be complaining[N]
too much, given I am here after all.[N]
Wait[Beat] Did I leave that somewhere else?[AN]
My bag feels a little lighter than normal.[N]
Did I just[Beat] get swindled?[N]
Mantou will pay for this.[A][X]

## Leina_Mantou_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeina][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidLeft]Mantou! Are you well?[N]
It's been a while.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! L-leina, how are you?[N]
I'm doing fine.[AN]
Swinging my axe, being a valuable[N]
contributor and model soldier.[AN]
Nothing out of the ordinary for me.[N]
Go team![A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's good. You looked pretty[N]
banged up last time we met.[AN]
You don't have any lingering[N]
injuries or pains?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Nope, none at all.[N]
You're quite good with a heal staff![A]
[OpenMidLeft]What about mental pain?[N]
Do you feel any trauma from the hit?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] What are you talking about?[N]
I'm lost.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Sometimes when people get injured,[N]
you know, a nasty cut or what have you,[AN]
they will feel anguish.[N]
They will feel unsettled.[AN]
Things that are seemingly innocuous will[N]
haunt them, as it reminds them of that pain.[AN]
Sometimes, they even feel guilt.[N]
Does any of this ring a bell?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Guilty? Um, no.[N]
Not at all.[AN]
That word isn't even in my vocabulary.[N]
I can't use it in a sentence.[AN]
I have nothing to be guilty about.[N]
Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that so? Well, you're quite[N]
brave, Mantou. Tougher than most.[AN]
I'm grateful you're here.[N]
[Beat] Truly.[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] And I am for you.[N]
I'd be long dead had you not showed up.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft][Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]Well, was there anything else[N]
I could help you with?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Well, you did jog my memory, Mantou.[N]
You see, sometime after we met,[N]
I lost something of value to me.[AN]
It was a rare staff that I had[N]
as a gift from[Beat] a friend, let's say.[AN]
I've been searching all over for it,[N]
but it appears I've misplaced it.[N]
You wouldn't happen to have seen it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]A staff? No, never.[N]
I only know the basic ones. Heal,[N]
mend, staves named Tina, that sort of thing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If you do hear anything,[N]
please let me know.[N]
Thank you for being so truthful, Mantou.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Um, of course![A][X]

## Leina_Mantou_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeina][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidRight]Leina! There you are.[N]
I've been looking everywhere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well met, Mantou.[N]
Are you well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, one hundred percent.[N]
I, er, felt remorse, I mean,[AN]
was very sad, deeply saddened, in fact,[N]
by the loss of your valued staff.[AN]
I, er, scrounged some gold together[N]
so you could buy a new one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you, that's very thoughtful.[N]
You didn't need to do that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was the least I could[N]
do after how bad I felt, I mean,[AN]
after you helped me.[N]
Here you go, I hope it is enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is[Beat][N] 
three thousand and twenty five pieces?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You[Beat] counted that quickly.[N]
How did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I've had it appraised before.[N]
A sentimental gift it was,[AN]
but I did want to see how valuable[N]
it could be on the market.[AN]
If I remember correctly,[N]
this is precisely a third of its value.[AN]
How did you gather this exact amount?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh you know, collecting donations[N]
from others, mainly.[AN]
So many were moved by your great loss, Leina.[N]
They just wanted to help, and-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]You sold it, didn't you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]W-what?![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't lie to me, Mantou.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not, I mean, I'm-[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]You stole the staff out of my bag[N]
when I was healing your scrape,[N]
then you sold it.[AN]
You lied to my face about stealing it,[N]
and then after I tried to wrangle[N]
a confession from you,[AN]
you felt guilty and decided to pay[N]
me a third of its resell value.[N]
For what? To make me feel better?[AN]
Mantou, how do you think Loewe and Cleo[N]
would respond if I told them about[N]
you stealing and lying from me?[AN]
I'll have you know, I am a noble.[N]
A very esteemed noble in my home country[N]
of Chouwouj. Beyond compare of all others.[AN]
I could easily get you maimed, jailed,[N]
killed, slow roasted-[A]
[OpenMidRight]Enough![N]
I can't take it anymore![N]
You're right! I'm terrible![AN]
I did all of those awful things.[N]
I've never felt such guilt![N]
I am sorry for what I did![AN]
Just don't tell Cleo![N]
She has eyes like a hawk and[N]
the talons to match, too![AN]
I'm not ready to die![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then you're going to have[N]
to make it up to me, Mantou.[N]
Do we have a deal?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes! I will do anything.[N]
Just about anything, at least.[N]
Just don't kill me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]No, I think I will find[N]
a better use for you.[A][X]
