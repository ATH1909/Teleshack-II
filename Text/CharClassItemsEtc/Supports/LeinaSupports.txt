[OpenMidRight]
Hey! Horse lady![N]
Help me out, over here![AN]
You're a healer, right?[N]
Well, heal me! Please![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh! Um, yes. Allow me.[N]
Are you alright?[AN]
You don't look too badly bruised.[N]
Heal staves are expensive, you know.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You pay for your own heal[N]
staves in the army?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, usually we steal[N]
them from our enemies, but-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
That's unacceptable.[N]
But you said they're expensive, right?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Expensive is a relative term,[N]
but I suppose it's no plate of[N]
rice and beans, if that's what you mean.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, anyway, I think I'm all healed[N]
up now. Thanks again for lending a hand.[N]
I'm Mantou, I'll see you later.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm[Beat] Leina.[N]
Well, that was abrupt.[N]
They really will let anyone fight with us, huh?[AN]
I suppose I shouldn't be complaining[N]
too much, given I am here after all.[N]
Wait[Beat] Did I leave that somewhere else?[AN]
My bag feels a little lighter than normal.[N]
Did I just[Beat] get swindled?[N]
Mantou will pay for this.[AN][X]

## Leina_Mantou_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeina][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidLeft]Mantou! Are you well?[N]
It's been a while.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! L-leina, how are you?[N]
I'm doing fine.[AN]
Swinging my axe, being a valuable[N]
contributor and model soldier.[AN]
Nothing out of the ordinary for me.[N]
Go team![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]That's good. You looked pretty[N]
banged up last time we met.[AN]
You don't have any lingering[N]
injuries or pains?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Nope, none at all.[N]
You're quite good with a heal staff![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]What about mental pain?[N]
Do you feel any trauma from the hit?[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] What are you talking about?[N]
I'm lost.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Sometimes when people get injured,[N]
you know, a nasty cut or what have you,[AN]
they will feel anguish.[N]
They will feel unsettled.[AN]
Things that are seemingly innocuous will[N]
haunt them, as it reminds them of that pain.[AN]
Sometimes, they even feel guilt.[N]
Does any of this ring a bell?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Guilty? Um, no.[N]
Not at all.[AN]
That word isn't even in my vocabulary.[N]
I can't use it in a sentence.[AN]
I have nothing to be guilty about.[N]
Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Is that so? Well, you're quite[N]
brave, Mantou. Tougher than most.[AN]
I'm grateful you're here.[N]
[Beat] Truly.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat] And I am for you.[N]
I'd be long dead had you not showed up.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidLeft][Beat][AN]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]Well, was there anything else[N]
I could help you with?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]Well, you did jog my memory, Mantou.[N]
You see, sometime after we met,[N]
I lost something of value to me.[AN]
It was a rare staff that I had[N]
as a gift from[Beat] a friend, let's say.[AN]
I've been searching all over for it,[N]
but it appears I've misplaced it.[N]
You wouldn't happen to have seen it?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]A staff? No, never.[N]
I only know the basic ones. Heal,[N]
mend, staves named Tina, that sort of thing.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]If you do hear anything,[N]
please let me know.[N]
Thank you for being so truthful, Mantou.[AN]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Um, of course![AN][X]

## Leina_Mantou_A

[OpenMidLeft][LoadLeina][OpenMidRight][LoadMantou]
[OpenMidRight]Leina! There you are.[N]
I've been looking everywhere.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Well met, Mantou.[N]
Are you well?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, one hundred percent.[N]
I, er, felt remorse, I mean,[AN]
was very sad, deeply saddened, in fact,[N]
by the loss of your valued staff.[AN]
I, er, scrounged some gold together[N]
so you could buy a new one.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you, that's very thoughtful.[N]
You didn't need to do that.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]It was the least I could[N]
do after how bad I felt, I mean,[AN]
after you helped me.[N]
Here you go, I hope it is enough.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]This is[Beat][N] 
three thousand and twenty five pieces?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]You[Beat] counted that quickly.[N]
How did you know?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I've had it appraised before.[N]
A sentimental gift it was,[AN]
but I did want to see how valuable[N]
it could be on the market.[AN]
If I remember correctly,[N]
this is precisely a third of its value.[AN]
How did you gather this exact amount?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Oh you know, collecting donations[N]
from others, mainly.[AN]
So many were moved by your great loss, Leina.[N]
They just wanted to help, and-[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]You sold it, didn't you?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]W-what?![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Don't lie to me, Mantou.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]I'm not, I mean, I'm-[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]You stole the staff out of my bag[N]
when I was healing your scrape,[N]
then you sold it.[AN]
You lied to my face about stealing it,[N]
and then after I tried to wrangle[N]
a confession from you,[AN]
you felt guilty and decided to pay[N]
me a third of its resell value.[N]
For what? To make me feel better?[AN]
Mantou, how do you think Loewe and Cleo[N]
would respond if I told them about[N]
you stealing and lying from me?[AN]
I'll have you know, I am a noble.[N]
A very esteemed noble in my home country[N]
of Chouwouj. Beyond compare of all others.[AN]
I could easily get you maimed, jailed,[N]
killed, slow roasted-[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Enough![N]
I can't take it anymore![N]
You're right! I'm terrible![AN]
I did all of those awful things.[N]
I've never felt such guilt![N]
I am sorry for what I did![AN]
Just don't tell Cleo![N]
She has eyes like a hawk and[N]
the talons to match, too![AN]
I'm not ready to die![AN]
[OpenMidLeft]Then you're going to have[N]
to make it up to me, Mantou.[N]
Do we have a deal?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Yes! I will do anything.[N]
Just about anything, at least.[N]
Just don't kill me![AN]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]No, I think I will find[N]
a better use for you.[AN][X]

Warlord Ngondala. [ToggleSmile]It's[N]

[MidRight]
Thank you. And you are[Beat][N]
Lady Leina, correct?[AN][N]
The maiden claiming descent[N]
from the royal family?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That I am.[AN][N]
But after everything that's[N]
happened on my journey, with[N]
Cromar, and now with Byelen[Beat][AN][N]
any hope of pressing that[N]
claim will have to wait.[AN]
[MidRight]
[CloseEyes]It is a shame to have to leave[N]
our homeland behind like this,[N]
even for a short time.[AN][N]
But such is the way of[N]
joining a cause like this one.[AN][N]
[Beat]Perhaps with Taraji's[N]
death, Chouwouj will somehow[N]
begin to heal on its own.[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I agree.[AN][N]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Ngondala, when I do go back to[N]
Chouwouj after this is all over[Beat][AN][N]
You are a powerful warlord, and[N]
known as a ruler of some renown.[AN][N]
[OpenEyes]Would you help me to rebuild[N]
the kingdom's royal family?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]No.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Thank you, Ngondala.[N]
I-[AN] Wait, what?[AN]
[MidRight]
You claim to be a descendant[N]
of the ruined royal family,[AN][N]
tracing your lineage back to the[N]
Warrior Queen Shaobing herself.[AN][N]
That may be so.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
But even still, what makes you[N]
think you are able to rule?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I don't understand what you mean.[AN][N]
I've gone on a journey for so long,[N]
sought out the holy bow Daybreak[Beat][AN][N]
Have those trials not[N]
proven me a worthy leader?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
The virtues of an adventurer[N]
and those of a queen are[N]
two very different things,[AN][N]
and the holy blood of a hero does[N]
not make you either on its own.[AN][N]
How do I know that as queen,[N]
you will not let Chouwouj fall[N]
back into its anarchy and ruin?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]That's[Beat] [CloseEyes]a good question.[AN][N]
I've never really thought[N]
about it before. I[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Go, Lady Leina, and[N]
think carefully on it.[AN][N]
If you are a hero who can[N]
save our fair Chouwouj,[AN][N]

Very well.[AN][N]
Speak, and tell me why you[N]
believe you can save Chouwouj.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's[Beat][AN][N]
I'm supposed to be worthy. That's[N]
what it means to be a princess.[AN][N]
Sure, I'm not a mythic hero[N]
who will destroy all evil.[AN][N]
But neither is anyone else[N]
who might seek to lead.[AN][N]
So many of my ancestors have sat[N]

Consider who my[N]

Your fellow warlords,[AN][N]
so many of whom are just[N]
men of violence and greed.[AN][N]
None of them care about Chouwouj[N]
as a country, a people, an ideal.[AN][N]
If not me, then who?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I understand, I think.[AN][N]
[CloseEyes]I love Chouwouj, Leina,[N]
just as you do.[AN][N]
That is exactly why[N]
I question you so.[AN][N]
There are few hands I[N]
trust to hold the[N]
reins of our homeland.[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What about your own hands?[AN][N]
Do you not wish to be a[N]
queen as well, Ngondala?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I fought to bring peace,[N]
not to claim rulership.[AN][N]
I[Beat] [CloseEyes]would not serve[N]
as a worthy monarch-[AN]

to fight as a warlord?[AN][N]
What right do you have to[N]

[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What is it that makes you[N]

or even any better[N]
than the Pitviper?[AN]
[MidRight]
[OpenEyes]That is enough! You have[N]
made your point, Leina.[AN][N]
Just consider one more thing.[AN][N]
The fallen monarchy of Chouwouj,[N]
that you so want to return to.[AN][N]
Were their failed kings and[N]
queens, the ones who led[N]
the land to its downfall,[AN][N]
any better or worse than you?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

How so? In our debate about[N]
the nature of ruling Chouwouj?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We were both wrong.[AN][N]
[CloseEyes]I thought my holy blood[N]

of how to be a good ruler.[AN][N]
But in the end, after all[N]
the things I've seen[Beat] I[N]
don't think I can rule.[AN][N]
I don't think I want to rule.[AN][N]
Even the other warlords[N]
I decried as nothing more than[N]
pretenders to the throne[Beat][AN][N]
even they remained in Chouwouj,[N]
taking some action in their[N]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ngondala, I can't even tell[N]
what you want or believe.[AN][N]
You care for the soul of Chouwouj,[N]

this army after Taraji's fall.[AN][N]
You fight as a warlord[N]

we would achieve them[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I do think that[N]
together, though,[AN][N]
we have the will to make[N]
a change in our own way.[AN][N]
We can build peace in Chouwouj,[N]
just as both of us want,[AN][N]
without forging it out of war[N]
or claiming an unworthy crown.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[OpenEyes]What idea do you have, Leina?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
The jungles of Chouwouj are vast.[AN][N]
No cruel warlord or tyrant king has[N]
power vast enough to rule them all.[AN][N]
That means there's always[N]
a distant place, somewhere,[AN][N]
for those who wish to flee the[N]
endless storms of conflict.[AN][N]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]That means there's[N]
room for us to step in.[AN]
