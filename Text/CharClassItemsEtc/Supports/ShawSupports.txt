Hey, Sera-[A]
[MidRight]
Not a chance.[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh come on, at least let me finish![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Let me guess, you're broke again[N]
and need to borrow some gold?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What did you waste it on this time?[N]
Some fancy drink caught your eye again?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Not just any old drink, but the drink[N]
of legends! Trust me, this was worth[N]
every coin! It's not every day you[AN]
come across a bottle of Captain Jeno's[N]
Whiskey. Really, for just 1,500 gold,[N]
it's a steal![A]
[MidRight]
You spent that much on a single bottle?[N]
It's no wonder you're always broke.[N]
You ever consider saving it up?[AN]
What if you find something you really[N]
want, but can't afford because you[N]
wasted all your gold on drinks?[A]
[MidLeft]
But what if what I really want is a[N]
fine bottle of whiskey? Just one sip[N]
and you'll understand.[AN]
Tell you what, lend me the coin I need[N]
and we'll split the bottle evenly[N]
between us, after this battle.[AN]
Alcohol tastes best when shared[N]
with friends, after all.[A]
[MidRight]
Alright, alright, I admit you've got[N]
me a bit curious, but you better pay[N]
me back soon! No more frivolous spending[AN]
until you do, okay?[N]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You got it.[A][X]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sera, is that your special technique[N]
or am I just seeing double.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not this time. You were right about[N]
that whiskey, I've never had such a[N]
strong yet delicious drink.[A]
[MidLeft]
What did I tell ya? Worth every coin![N]
And to think you could outdrink me![N]
I gotta say, I'm impressed.[AN]
Say, this war's nearing the end, isn't[N]
it? Have you thought about coming back[N]
to the Grand Oceanic Arena afterwards?[AN]
Both in the arena and on the,[N]
battlefield, we make a great team![A]
[MidRight]
I don't get it Shaw, why is that place[N]
so special to you? The way I see it,[N]
all fighting's the same, all that[AN]
changes is who I'm cutting down.[A]
[MidLeft]
More than anywhere, the arena is where[N]
you can truly put your skills to the[N]
test. Everyone's on even footing,[AN]
so only the strongest and most[N]
tenacious will prevail.[AN]
The pay's pretty good too.[A]
[MidRight]
When you put it like that, I can see[N]
the appeal. Still, there's so much more[N]
of Orodreth I want to see.[AN]
If I stay put, I'll limit my development[N]
as a swordswoman. I want to be able to[AN]
fight in all kinds of battles, not just[N]
pit fights.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I get it, in the end, we're[N]
just too different.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I suppose we are[Beat] Anyway, can't be[N]
too hard to find another swordfighter[N]
to join your squad, right?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, you're irreplaceable. There's no one[N]
I trust more to have my back in battle.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Is that so? Well, it's like you said,[N]
we make a great team. Fine, once this[N]
is all over, we'll make one last run.[AN]
I'll see just how far my swordsmanship[N]
has come since we joined the Liberators.[A]
[MidLeft]
Alright! We'll win so much gold[N]
that I'll never have to borrow[N]
from you again.[A]
[MidRight]
Heh, I'll be holding you to that.[N]
No matter how you beg, I won't lend[N]
you a single coin![A][X]
