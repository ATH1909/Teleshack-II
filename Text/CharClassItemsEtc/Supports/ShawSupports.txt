Hey, Hornet, how'd you like to join[N]
my pit fighting squad after the war.[AN]
We could use someone with your skills[N]
backing us up.[A]
[MidLeft]
Do you do all your recruiting on the[N]
battlefield, or is this an exception?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I don't make a habit of it, but it's[N]
not every day I witness such incredible[N]
archery.[A] I don't know anyone else so[N]
accurate at such long range.[A]
[MidLeft]
What about that makes you think I'd[N]
be suited to pit fighting?[AN]
I'm neither suited for nor interested[N]
in close quarters combat.[A]
[MidRight]
Afraid of getting hit? Don't worry[N]
about it, I won't let any anyone[N]
get past me![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, that's not it. Someone like[N]
you wouldn't understand.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
What do you mean by someone like me?[N]
Wait, come back![A][X]

Be careful! There's only so[N]
much I can cover for you.[A]
[MidLeft]
I don't remember asking you[N]
to do any such thing.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You don't have to, I always have my[N]
allies' backs.[A] But I gotta ask, how[N]
come you didn't fire back at those[N]
enemy archers earlier?[AN]
They were wide open.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's[Beat] They were too close.[N]
That's all it was.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, come on. Aren't you stoic types[N]
supposed to be better liars than this?[AN]
Just tell me what's going on, and I'll[N]
see if I can't find a way to help out.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ugh, you're not going to let[N]
this go, are you?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Nope.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You are annoyingly persistent.[N]
Anyone else ever tell you that?[A]
[MidRight]
Once or tw-[N]
Hey, don't change the subject![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Alright, alright, you really want to[N]
know?[A] The truth is, if I get close[N]
enough to see their face, I lose[N]
my nerve.[A] Some are real bad guys,[N]
but most are just soldiers like us,[N]
fighting for what they believe in.[AN]
I can see it in their eyes.[AN]
From afar, I can shoot them without[N]
hesitation, but I just can't do it[N]
up close.[A]
[MidRight]
You can see their eyes from that far?[N]
Gotta say, that's the first I've[N]
heard of a problem like that.[A]
[MidLeft]
This is why I didn't want to tell you![N]
Like I said, someone like you[N]
wouldn't understand.[A]
[MidRight]
Sure, I can't exactly relate, but I[N]
bet I can think of something to help.[N]
I just[Beat] need a bit to think.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Really, don't worry about it. Better[N]
yet, forget we had this conversation.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
That could have gone better[Beat][N]
Now I've really gotta think[N]
of something.[A][X]

Hey, Hornet, you got a minute?[A]
[MidLeft]
What is it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I've been doing some thinking[N]
about our last chat, and I've[N]
some ideas.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh no[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Wait, wait, hear me out![AN]
When I'm fighting, I can see my[N]
opponents up face to face.[A] Some are[N]
hired blades trying to make some coin.[AN]
Some are true believers, willing to[N]
lay down their lives for the cause.[AN]
Some have no business being on the[N]
battlefield at all.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What's the point of all this? You're[N]
telling me what I already know.[A]
[MidRight]
Not once did I look on them with pity.[AN]
Like us, they have resaons to fight,[N]
and they'll show us no mercy.[AN]
It's only right we offer them the[N]
same respect.[A]
[MidLeft]
Respect, huh[Beat] That's a perspective[N]
I hadn't considered.[AN]
Don't think itreally helps me though.[AN]
Up close you can knock them out[N]
or capture them.[AN]
I don't have the same luxuries.[AN]
I can only shoot to kill.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, I figured as much. Nothing's[N]
ever that easy, after all.[AN]
But really, you don't need to change.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] don't? Then what was[N]
the point of all this?[AN]
[MidRight]
I, er, dunno. Thought maybe you'd[N]
be interested in my perspective?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What? Heh, you really are[N]
annoying persistent.[AN]
That aside, what do you mean by[N]
me not needing to change?[A]
[MidRight]
Everyone handles war differently.[AN]
I'm not going to judge, and I'm not[N]
going to spread word around camp[N]
and ruin your stoic image.[AN]
What matters is you're the best[N]
sharpshooter this army has,[A] and[N]
now I know how to best help you[N]
in battle.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Huh, thanks Shaw. You're a[N]
surprisingly helpful ally.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Surprisingly? No, I must have misheard.[N]
Anyway, once this war's over, maybe[N]
reconsider pit fighting, huh?[AN]
Perhaps it'll be a hidden talent.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hah, don't push your luck.[A][X]

Hey, Sera-[A]
[MidRight]
Not a chance.[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh come on, at least let me finish![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Let me guess, you're broke again[N]
and need to borrow some gold?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What did you waste it on this time?[N]
Some fancy drink caught your eye again?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Not just any old drink, but the drink[N]
of legends! Trust me, this was worth[N]
every coin![A] It's not every day you[N]
come across a bottle of Captain Jeno's[N]
Whiskey.[A] Really, for just 1,500 gold,[N]
it's a steal![A]
[MidRight]
You spent that much on a single bottle?[N]
It's no wonder you're always broke.[N]
You ever consider saving it up?[AN]
What if you find something you really[N]
want, but can't afford because you[N]
wasted all your gold on drinks?[A]
[MidLeft]
But what if what I really want is a[N]
fine bottle of whiskey? Just one sip[N]
and you'll understand.[AN]
Tell you what, lend me the coin I need[N]
and we'll split the bottle evenly[N]
between us, after this battle.[AN]
Alcohol tastes best when shared[N]
with friends, after all.[A]
[MidRight]
Alright, alright, I admit you've got[N]
me a bit curious, but you better pay[N]
me back soon![AN]
No more frivolous spending until[N]
you do, okay?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You got it.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadSera]
[MidLeft][MidBlink]
Sera, is that your special technique[N]
or am I just seeing double.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not this time. You were right about[N]
that whiskey, I've never had such a[N]
strong yet delicious drink.[A]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
What did I tell ya? Worth every coin![N]
And to think you could outdrink me![N]
I gotta say, I'm impressed.[AN]
Say, this war's nearing the end, isn't[N]
it? Have you thought about coming back[N]
to the Grand Oceanic Arena afterwards?[AN]
Both in the arena and on the,[N]
battlefield, we make a great team![A]
[MidRight]
I don't get it Shaw, why is that place[N]
so special to you?[A] The way I see it,[N]
all fighting's the same,[A] all that[N]
changes is who I'm cutting down.[A]
[MidLeft]
More than anywhere, the arena is where[N]
you can truly put your skills to the[N]
test. Everyone's on even footing,[AN]
so only the strongest and most[N]
tenacious will prevail.[AN]
The pay's pretty good too.[A]
[MidRight]
When you put it like that, I can see[N]
the appeal. Still, there's so much more[N]
of Orodreth I want to see.[AN]
If I stay put, I'll stunt my development[N]
as a swordswoman.[A] I want to be able to[N]
fight in all kinds of battles, not just[N]
pit fights.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I get it, in the end, we're[N]
just too different.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I suppose we are[Beat] Anyway, can't be[N]
too hard to find another swordfighter[N]
to join your squad, right?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No, you're irreplaceable. There's no one[N]
I trust more to have my back in battle.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Is that so? Well, it's like you said,[N]
we make a great team. Fine, once this[N]
is all over, we'll make one last run.[AN]
I'll see just how far my swordsmanship[N]
has come since we joined the Liberators.[A]
[MidLeft]
Alright! We'll win so much gold[N]
that I'll never have to borrow[N]
from you again.[A]
[MidRight]
Heh, I'll be holding you to that.[N]
No matter how you beg, I won't lend[N]
you a single coin![A][X]
