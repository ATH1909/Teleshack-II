Excuse me, sir. You mind telling me[N]
a bit about that sword of yours?[AN]
I can feel the magic comin' off it,[N]
so it must be something real special.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Do you, too, walk the path of the blade?[AN]
I didn't think that one as young as you[N]
would understand, but perhaps I erred.[N]
What is your name, young one?[AN]
[MidRight]
Asha, sir. I wouldn't put it that way,[N]
but you could say I have an interest[N]
in blades like the one you got there.[AN]
I've seen a few old swords, dating back[N]
to the Reclamation Wars, but none of[N]
'em compare to this one in rarity.[AN]
How'd you ever come across it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's a long story, I'm afraid.[N]
One that only a true follower of the[N]
blade could ever hope to comprehend.[AN]
If you still wish to know the tale[Beat][N]
Then you'll need to become stronger,[N]
and your technique must be sharper.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] So I gotta get strong to know[N]
more, huh? Well, swordsmanship isn't[N]
really my main focus, so to speak.[AN]
It's just something I learned to[N]
defend myself when I was younger,[N]
so I don't know how to train all proper.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Is that so[Beat] Very well. I will teach[N]
you what I can, so long as you have[N]
the determination necessary to learn.[AN]
If I deem you worthy, only then will[N]
I tell you the story of the Muramasa.[AN]
[MidRight]
Really? That sounds like a lot of work,[N]
but I guess being able to fight better[N]
is good anyway[Beat] Alright, I'm in![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Excellent.[N]
We'll begin at once![A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Asha, it seems you've been training[N]
dilligently. I can already see the[N]
difference in your abilities.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, really? So am I good enough[N]
to hear about that sword now?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, not yet. Your technique still[N]
needs refinement before that day.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm, alright[Beat] I don't really get it,[N]
though. I feel like I'm not doing[N]
much more than I usually would.[AN]
You sure these lessons of yours[N]
actually make a difference?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, as it happens, I'm self-taught[N]
as well. My technique is nothing special,[N]
but at least I do have a semblance of it.[AN]
You, though[Beat] What life did you live,[N]
to use a sword without walking its path?[AN]
[MidRight]
Uh[Beat] You mean why I didn't learn it[N]
proper? Well, I didn't have a choice,[N]
not as just another Wustheim orphan.[AN]
I never had a proper mentor, and the[N]
closest thing to one in my life was[N]
a man who taught me all he knew, Ulri.[AN]
Picking locks, stealing, how to use[N]
a dagger[Beat] Maybe he woulda taught[N]
me more, but one day he never came back.[AN]
I always guessed that some Cythean[N]
soldier got him on a heist too big[N]
for him, but I'll never know now.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm sorry to hear that.[N]
He must have been a kind man,[N]
despite his criminal deeds.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]He was. After that, I left town[N]
for Telyada, and Miss Houvaina saw me[N]
scrounging for food and took me in.[AN]
Later, I decided to join the Sacred[N]
Arrow Rebels to pay my debt, so[N]
I had to use a proper weapon.[AN]
A sword was the closest to a dagger.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Yes, that does explain your[N]
unorthodox way of wielding them.[AN]
A reverse grip like that isn't[N]
very practical for a sword.[AN]
You should always keep your thumbs[N]
closer to the hilt while swinging[N]
it, as that position is more powerful.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'll keep that in mind, sir. Anyway,[N]
I'm gonna take off and go looking[N]
for any valuables people dropped.[AN]
Maybe I'll use 'em to buy[N]
a nice shiny sword, heh![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
I've hidden the story from Asha[N]
long enough. Next time, I'll tell[N]
her[Beat] I'll tell her everything.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAsha][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, sir! You saw all my swordplay[N]
out there, right? Is it good enough[N]
yet for me to hear the story?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes, it is. In truth, your[N]
swordsmanship passed that[N]
threshold long ago, Asha.[AN]
But when I tell you this story,[N]
make sure not to tell anyone.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course! At last, I can hear how[N]
to ste- er, to start my search[N]
for another weapon like it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Unfortunately, there isn't much[N]
to say. I stole the weapon from[N]
a bandit leader that I defeated.[AN]
Whether it is a sword like the[N]
ones you mentioned is something[N]
that I cannot determine[Beat][AN]
But to my eye, it's nothing special.[N]
I'm sorry for deceiving you,[N]
but you seemed so excited about it.[AN]
I didn't have the heart to tell[N]
you the Muramasa's true significance[N]
is in how it intimidates our enemies.[AN]
It holds no inherent worth.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Asha?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh, don't worry. I already figured[N]
out that it wasn't worth much itself.[AN]
I tried using it myself one time,[N]
but it just seemed like junk.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm just going to ignore that you[N]
tried using it without my permission.[AN]
Hm[Beat] What do you mean by [OpenQuote]itself?"[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, right! Well, that sword training[N]
felt kinda useless for a while,[N]
but now, I can sorta[Beat] see stuff?[AN]
You know, like how the Muramasa[N]
gives off a dark glow, right?[AN]
Well, it got brighter as I trained[N]
more, and magic swords all glow[N]
similarly as far as I can see, too.[AN]
[MidLeft]
This glowing you're referring to[Beat][AN]
I've never heard of anything like it,[N]
and I'm not sure how my training[N]
would have enhanced that gift.[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe it helped me focus?[AN]
[Beat]Well, no reason to wonder too much.[N]
The important part is,[N]
the Muramasa is a key.[AN]
Something that'll lead us to another[N]
sword, that actually IS special![AN]
One of the most enduring legends[N]
among Mahemeni treasure hunters[N]
is the Sword of Light, you see.[AN]
The temple containing it is said to[N]
be deep in the desert, sealed off,[N]
but it opens under one condition.[AN]
That is, bringing a sword of dark magic[N]
and using that as a tool to break[N]
the binding on the temple exterior.[AN]
Since you taught me some stuff,[N]
I wouldn't mind finding it for you[Beat][N]
If you want a real legendary sword.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Very well. If you really have an[N]
idea, then I'll help you search.[AN]
Treasure hunting, eh[Beat][N]
If it helps take my swordplay to[N]
greater heights, I'll do anything![A][X]

The way you carry your blade,[N]
there's no mistaking it[Beat][N]
Have you studied under Narai of Zinra?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You have a good eye. Long ago, he[N]
taught me the art of swordfighting.[AN]
I'm surprised you knew him, few[N]
travelers come all the way to Zinra.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I met him just once, many years ago.[N]
Back then, I was but a lowly soldier,[N]
marching under the warlord Xun's banner.[AN]
Narai singlehandedly halted our advance.[AN]
Not one of us could land a single blow[N]
against him. It was as if he was dancing,[N]
and the battlefield was his stage.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Xun[Beat] I heard about him. He was[N]
said to be a terror in combat.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
He was indeed. I had never met someone[N]
as mighty as him until I saw him felled[N]
so effortlessly, before my very eyes.[AN]
Ever since that day, it has been my goal[N]
to become as great a swordsman as him.[AN]
You are most fortunate to have learned[N]
from a true master.[A]
[ClearFace][MidRight]
Fortunate, huh?[AN]
I can see where he's coming from, yet[N]
it seems I'm cursed to be forever[N]
overshadowed by my old teacher[Beat][A][X]

That blade of yours, I've never seen[N]
such a sinister looking weapon.[A]
[MidLeft]
This demon blade is called [0x93]Muramasa,"[N]
you could call it my signature weapon.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Signature weapon, huh? It hurts my[N]
pride to admit it, but I can't help[N]
but be a bit envious of you.[AN]
Your techniques and your sword[N]
are truly one of a kind.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hah, that's ridiculous. I have little[N]
talent, and Muramasa is just another[N]
weapon to anyone but me.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
But you just called it a [0x93]demon blade!"[AN]
And it looks so sinister too[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I'll tell you how I got it, but you[N]
must never tell anyone else.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Of course, your secret is safe with me.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Several years ago, I was hired to[N]
eliminate a gang of bandits along[N]
the coast of Decia.[AN]
They were led by the a fearsome warrior[N]
by the name of Jerrick, known to wield[N]
a cursed sword said to fell its[AN]
victims in a single blow.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
So how'd you beat him?[A]
[MidLeft]
I swept his leg and tripped him.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Seriously? What kind of[N]
swordsman are you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The kind who does what it takes to win.[AN]
Anyway, it turns out the sword itself[N]
is nothing special. It's similar to[N]
that [0x93]killing edge" I've seen you use.[AN]
What matters is the fear it strikes in[N]
the hearts of my enemies as I swing it.[A]
[MidRight]
What a ridiculous story. Say,[N]
after this battle, let's spar.[AN]
I find there's no better way to[N]
understand a fellow swordsman,[AN]
and I'd love to test your[N]
techniques myself.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You're on. I never had a rematch with[N]
Narai, but this may be even better![A][X]

## CarlSeraASupport
[MidLeft][LoadCarl][MidRight][LoadSera]
Carl, that feint of yours, the third[N]
one from our sparring match[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I was waiting for you to mention it.[N]
There was no way you wouldn't notice.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
How could I not? I'd recognize the[N]
dancing blade style anywhere.[N]
But there was something off about it[Beat][AN]
If I hadn't been so surprised by it,[N]
I'd have seen right through it![A]
[MidLeft]
That's just it. My natural aptitude[N]
for swordplay is poor, so mastering a[N]
single style is impossible for me.[AN]
By learning the techniques of others,[N]
I've got so many moves that no one can[AN]
predict which I'll use, even if I[N]
can't do them as well as an expert.[A]
[MidRight]
Incredible, I've never faced such a[N]
strange opponent as you. Your movements[N]
were crude, but somehow unnerving.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yet I never landed a single blow on you.[N]
I can tell you are a genuine master of[N]
the dancing blade style.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
No, I've still got a ways to go[N]
before I can match up to Narai.[A]
[MidLeft]
That final thrust you dodged,[N]
I learned that move from Xun.[AN]
Narai had to block that thrust,[N]
but you gracefully evaded it.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Heh, is that so? I can't believe how[N]
silly I've been. Hey, once this war[N]
is over, let's duel again.[AN]
I'll be sure to surprise you with[N]
some techniques of my own.[A]
[MidLeft]
I look forward to it. This time,[N]
my blade will strike true.[A][X]
