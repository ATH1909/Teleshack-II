Oy, Locke! What are ya doin' over[N]
here, sittin' around while the[N]
rest o' us are riskin' our lives?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm? I don't see what any of[N]
that has to do with me, miss[Beat][N]
Who are you, exactly? I forget.[AN]
[MidRight]
The name's Joie, ya lout![AN]
A proper knight of Freyse,[N]
or at least, I used t' be.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, you're one of those, are you?[AN]
Sorry, but I don't do well with[N]
knightly types. Too uptight.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uptight, eh? I'll show ya uptight,[N]
when I report ya to the commanders[N]
for bein' a waste o' gold![AN]
Any amount for this kind o' help[N]
is a waste for our coffers![AN]
[MidLeft]
Woah, settle down there.[AN]
You'd be wasting your time,[N]
because those two tykes[N]
know full well my worth.[AN]
[MidRight]
Whaddaya mean by that, Locke?[AN]
Looks t' me like you're worth[N]
a whole lot of nothin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, it'd be a waste to explain[N]
it to you since you wouldn't get it.[N]
Try thinking for yourself, Joie.[AN]
I've got[Beat] business to take care of.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hey, don't walk away![AN]
I'm not done yet-[.6][N]
Wait, you DID know m' name![A][X]

Looks like all is as usual[Beat][N]
Man, what a boring job.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadDarcy]
There ya are, Locke.[N]
I've been lookin' for ya.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, really? Have you given[N]
my words any thought, Joie?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Mm, I thought long n' hard about 'em.[N]
Didn't do me any good, so then I[N]
watched ya work instead.[AN]
Now I see whatcha meant, Locke.[N]
You were[Beat] watchin' the battlefield,[N]
right? Keepin' an eye on the flank.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you can do it if you try, eh?[AN]
That's right. You never know who[N]
might show up during a battle[Beat][N]
and what they might show up with.[AN]
It's good practice to have someone[N]
ready to steal it out of their hands.[AN]
[MidRight]
Aye, that makes sense t' me.[N]
That said, why not just tell me, then?[AN]
I don't see the point in hidin' it.[N]
[MidLeft]
The point is that my actions are on[N]
a need-to-know basis, and you,[N]
my dear knight, don't need to know.[AN]
So long as the bosses up top approve[N]
the orders, that's all that matters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, but I can't agree with that.[AN]
There's nothin' wrong with lettin'[N]
yer comrades what you're up to,[N]
right? We deserve that much.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Comrades? Joie, I think[N]
there's a misunderstanding.[N]
I'm here to get paid.[AN]
Your cause means nothing to me,[N]
except for how much it's worth.[AN]
Don't ever forget that.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fine, I won't. My mistake fer[N]
thinkin' you had even a scrap[N]
of a soul in there, Locke.[A]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]And what use is a soul?[AN][OpenEyes]
Didn't do me any good before.[N]
Gold, though[Beat] Gold can get[N]
you anything. Anything at all[Beat][A]

[Beat]Boring as always, I see.[N]
What I wouldn't do for a[N]
large, red, metal distraction[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadJoie]
Back at yer old tricks, eh Locke?[AN]
Well, perk your head up fer a bit.[N]
I've got somethin' to ask ya.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right on cue! Normally, I'd charge[N]
for consultation[Beat] But clearly,[N]
you couldn't afford it anyway.[AN]
Ask away, Joie.[A]
[MidRight]
Right. I was thinkin' about what[N]
ya said before, about gold n' all.[AN]
Felt like ya were speakin' from[N]
experience there. Tell me,[N]
how'd ya become such a lemon?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, you have such a funny way[N]
of describing it, Joie[Beat][AN]
Well, I have no intention of telling[N]
you about my arduous, long-winded[N]
backstory. No time for it, really.[AN]
Suffice it to say, I realized[N]
what suckers like you haven't,[N]
because of my experiences.[AN]
Let me pose you a question, Joie.[N]
What makes this fine army tick?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, ain't that obvious?[N]
The people willin' to join![AN]
Without them, we wouldn't[N]
have the manpower to march[N]
on Cythes and fight back.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wrong![A] Grunts like you are the easiest[N]
to replace. There are plenty of fools[N]
out there eager to fall on a sword.[AN]
The problem is, how do you feed them?[AN]
Outfit them with armor and weaponry?[AN]
That's right, it all comes back to gold![AN]
Gold is power, and gold is justice.[N]
If you want any of either,[N]
then start saving your coins.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Ye're not all wrong, Locke,[N]
but that's such a sad way t' live.[N]
Where'd you learn somethin' like that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I'm not telling you[N]
a thing, but[Beat] let's put it this way.[AN]
Life is an arena, and we're all[N]
just pit fighters. You either earn[N]
coin, or you eat dirt. Got it, Joie?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So what ye're tellin' me is that[N]
I should go fight in an arena?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, that's not[Beat] You know what,[N]
sure. Go to the Yuria Islands,[N]
and become a master pit fighter.[AN]
Maybe then, you'll understand.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sounds like a fun challenge.[N]
Alright, I'm in! I'll prove that[N]
I'm better then the rest,[AN]
and I'll donate every last piece[N]
of gold to Decia's reconstruction.[A]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] idiotic, but do what[N]
you want with the spoils.[N]
Maybe I'll go back there[Beat][AN]
It's risky, but there's not going[N]
to be any better source of gold[N]
out there with the war drying up.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, nothin' personal if I end[N]
up bein' the one to take you down.[N]
May the best pit fighter win![A][X]
