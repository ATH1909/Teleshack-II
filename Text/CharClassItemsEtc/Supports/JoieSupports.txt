The plant[Beat] I could not find it during[N]
our travels. This is a disappointment,[N]
yet I gathered valuable information.[AN]
My time with this troop may still prove[N]
useful, once this is all over[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadJoie]
Hey, buddy! What're you doin'[N]
over here, mutterin' to yourself?[AN]
We've got a chokepoint to hold![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm? Ah, nothing to be concerned about.[N]
Actually[Beat] who are you? A new recruit?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, did I not introduce myself?[N]
The name's Joie. Pleasure to meet ya![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Likewise. I see you, too, understand[N]
the utility that armor can grant you.[N]
You may call me Pelecaye, my friend.[AN]
[MidRight]
Right, that's actually what I came[N]
over here for to ask ya. You've got[N]
that armor but move so quick![AN]
I've been wonderin' what yer[N]
secret is, to be able to do that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
My secret, hm[Beat] I would require[N]
monetary compensation to tell you.[AN]
You see, I am looking for a plant,[N]
and every gold piece brings me[N]
closer to my goal of acquiring it.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That so? Well, I ain't got much[N]
to spend, so count me out.[AN]
You can keep yer secrets, Pelecaye.[N]
I'm plenty strong as it is.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] That's not the reaction[N]
I expected. Still, she isn't wrong.[N]
Perhaps she has a secret of her own[Beat][A][X]

Another day on the warfront, eh?[N]
Well, ain't nothin' tough about it![AN]
I've seen worse enemies in my sleep![AN]
[MidLeft][LoadPelecaye]
My apologies for my tardiness, Joie.[N]
A plant unique to this region[N]
distracted me with its beauty.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't worry, I get ya, Pelecaye.[AN]
I'm seein' so many things I never[N]
saw back home with the Liberators,[N]
so I understand what ya mean.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Tell me something, Joie.[N]
You asked me about the secret to[N]
my unexpected mobility, correct?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, yeah, but you wouldn't fess up.[N]
No sense in pushin' the issue, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'm grateful for you not prying.[N]
However, from my perspective,[N]
you must have a secret as well.[AN]
How else can one explain the[N]
immense strength that you possess?[AN]
I have trained all my life,[N]
and yet, I cannot match it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, shucks! You're real kind Pelecaye,[N]
but I don't think I got anythin' special.[AN]
And even if I did have a secret of some[N]
sort, well[Beat] You may not be able to[N]
do it yerself, no matter how ya tried.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Now I am only more curious, Joie.[AN]
That strength may help me in my[N]
search of a certain elusive plant,[N]
so allow me to offer you a trade.[AN]
I will teach you the secret to my[N]
light feet, if you teach me the[N]
principles behind your strength.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Well, alright! Y'see,[N]
ya just have to do this[Beat][N]
*whisper*[.7] *whisper*[.7] *whisper*[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No[Beat] that cannot be all![N]
Is that truly all there is?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yup! Now it's your turn, Pelecaye.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well.[N]
First, you must[Beat][A][X]

Oy, Pelecaye! What gives?[AN]
All those tips you gave me[N]
aren't doin' a single thing![AN]
I finally found a good sand patch[N]
to run through, but all it does[N]
is slow me down more than anythin'![AN]
[MidLeft]
My results aren't instant, you know.[N]
It takes time to become one with[N]
the desert, and any other terrain.[AN]
Besides, I could say the same to you.[N]
How do you expect anyone to juggle[N]
hay bales as an introductory exercise?![AN]
[MidRight]
Huh? What's so strange about that?[N]
Doesn't everyone move hay bales around?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't expect that even most farmers[N]
do anything like what you suggest.[N]
Where did you learn something so odd?[AN]
[MidRight]
It ain't odd, my pa taught me that![AN]
You shoulda seen him if you're so[N]
shocked by what I can do, Pelecaye.[N]
He'd juggle three at a time![AN]
[MidLeft]
What a monstrous family[Beat][N]
I see now that you were right.[N]
I could never replicate this.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, don't get down on yerself.[N]
I doubt I'm ever gonna get down[N]
that weird movement you do, either.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Then it seems there's only[N]
one way to acquire your strength.[AN]
What would you say to joining my[N]
company in search of the plant?[AN]
I can compensate you handsomely.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Y'know, you never said[N]
what the plant was, Pelecaye.[N]
If you tell, maybe I'll consider it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is difficult to describe to one[N]
who lacks the necessary knowledge,[N]
but very well. I will try, Joie.[AN]
It looks like[Beat] *whisper*[.7] *whisper*[.7][N]
And it can be used to make[Beat] *whisper*[.7][AN]
[MidRight]
What? Yer yankin' my chain, Pelecaye![AN]
If that's the case, then I'm in.[N]
This is the discovery of a lifetime![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm glad you see it my way, my armored[N]
companion. Together, we will reshape[N]
history itself with our discovery![A][X]

Oy, Locke! What are ya doin' over[N]
here, sittin' around while the[N]
rest o' us are riskin' our lives?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm? I don't see what any of[N]
that has to do with me, miss[Beat][N]
Who are you, exactly? I forget.[AN]
[MidRight]
The name's Joie, ya lout![AN]
A proper knight of Freyse,[N]
or at least, I used t' be.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, you're one of those, are you?[AN]
Sorry, but I don't do well with[N]
knightly types. Too uptight.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uptight, eh? I'll show ya uptight,[N]
when I report ya to the commanders[N]
for bein' a waste o' gold![AN]
Any amount for this kind o' help[N]
is a waste for our coffers![AN]
[MidLeft]
Woah, settle down there.[AN]
You'd be wasting your time,[N]
because those two tykes[N]
know full well my worth.[AN]
[MidRight]
Whaddaya mean by that, Locke?[AN]
Looks t' me like you're worth[N]
a whole lot of nothin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, it'd be a waste to explain[N]
it to you since you wouldn't get it.[N]
Try thinking for yourself, Joie.[AN]
I've got[Beat] business to take care of.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hey, don't walk away![AN]
I'm not done yet-[.6][N]
Wait, you DID know m' name![A][X]

## JoieLockeBSupport
[MidLeft][LoadLocke]
Looks like all is as usual[Beat][N]
Man, what a boring job.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadDarcy]
There ya are, Locke.[N]
I've been lookin' for ya.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, really? Have you given[N]
my words any thought, Joie?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Mm, I thought long n' hard about 'em.[N]
Didn't do me any good, so then I[N]
watched ya work instead.[AN]
Now I see whatcha meant, Locke.[N]
You were[Beat] watchin' the battlefield,[N]
right? Keepin' an eye on the flank.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So you can do it if you try, eh?[AN]
That's right. You never know who[N]
might show up during a battle[Beat][N]
and what they might show up with.[AN]
It's good practice to have someone[N]
ready to steal it out of their hands.[AN]
[MidRight]
Aye, that makes sense t' me.[N]
That said, why not just tell me, then?[AN]
I don't see the point in hidin' it.[N]
[MidLeft]
The point is that my actions are on[N]
a need-to-know basis, and you,[N]
my dear knight, don't need to know.[AN]
So long as the bosses up top approve[N]
the orders, that's all that matters.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, but I can't agree with that.[AN]
There's nothin' wrong with lettin'[N]
yer comrades what you're up to,[N]
right? We deserve that much.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Comrades? Joie, I think[N]
there's a misunderstanding.[N]
I'm here to get paid.[AN]
Your cause means nothing to me,[N]
except for how much it's worth.[AN]
Don't ever forget that.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Fine, I won't. My mistake fer[N]
thinkin' you had even a scrap[N]
of a soul in there, Locke.[A]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
[Beat]And what use is a soul?[AN][OpenEyes]
Didn't do me any good before.[N]
Gold, though[Beat] Gold can get[N]
you anything. Anything at all[Beat][A]

[MidLeft][LoadLocke][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Boring as always, I see.[N]
What I wouldn't do for a[N]
large, red, metal distraction[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadJoie]
Back at yer old tricks, eh Locke?[AN]
Well, perk your head up fer a bit.[N]
I've got somethin' to ask ya.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right on cue! Normally, I'd charge[N]
for consultation[Beat] But clearly,[N]
you couldn't afford it anyway.[AN]
Ask away, Joie.[A]
[MidRight]
Right. I was thinkin' about what[N]
ya said before, about gold n' all.[AN]
Felt like ya were speakin' from[N]
experience there. Tell me,[N]
how'd ya become such a lemon?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, you have such a funny way[N]
of describing it, Joie[Beat][AN]
Well, I have no intention of telling[N]
you about my arduous, long-winded[N]
backstory. No time for it, really.[AN]
Suffice it to say, I realized[N]
what suckers like you haven't,[N]
because of my experiences.[AN]
Let me pose you a question, Joie.[N]
What makes this fine army tick?[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, ain't that obvious?[N]
The people willin' to join![AN]
Without them, we wouldn't[N]
have the manpower to march[N]
on Cythes and fight back.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wrong![A] Grunts like you are the easiest[N]
to replace. There are plenty of fools[N]
out there eager to fall on a sword.[AN]
The problem is, how do you feed them?[AN]
Outfit them with armor and weaponry?[AN]
That's right, it all comes back to gold![AN]
Gold is power, and gold is justice.[N]
If you want any of either,[N]
then start saving your coins.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Ye're not all wrong, Locke,[N]
but that's such a sad way t' live.[N]
Where'd you learn somethin' like that?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Like I said, I'm not telling you[N]
a thing, but[Beat] let's put it this way.[AN]
Life is an arena, and we're all[N]
just pit fighters. You either earn[N]
coin, or you eat dirt. Got it, Joie?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So what ye're tellin' me is that[N]
I should go fight in an arena?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, that's not[Beat] You know what,[N]
sure. Go to the Yuria Islands,[N]
and become a master pit fighter.[AN]
Maybe then, you'll understand.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sounds like a fun challenge.[N]
Alright, I'm in! I'll prove that[N]
I'm better then the rest,[AN]
and I'll donate every last piece[N]
of gold to Decia's reconstruction.[A]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] idiotic, but do what[N]
you want with the spoils.[N]
Maybe I'll go back there[Beat][AN]
It's risky, but there's not going[N]
to be any better source of gold[N]
out there with the war drying up.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, nothin' personal if I end[N]
up bein' the one to take you down.[N]
May the best pit fighter win![A][X]
