...So what is our next goal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
We need to pass through[N]
the Black Forest.[AN]
...Unfortunatly, Cidor already[N] 
has forces there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Doesn't sound like anything we haven't[N]
dealt with before.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, apparently the empire has[N]
been recruiting from nearby villages.[AN]
It seems like popular opinion is[N]
turning against us...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wish I could say I'm suprised.[AN]
Maybe deciding to work with Radnitz...[AN]
[MidLeft]
We've been over this.[AN]
...In addition, [Red]allegedly some empire[N]
veterans will be arriving soon.[AN]
We'll need to hurry.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Red]...What will stop them[N]
from pursuing us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
There is a gate[N]
within the forest.[AN]
If we pass through[N]
and seal it behind us,[AN]
we should be able to[N]
buy ourselves time to escape.[AN]
[MidRight]
...It'll have to do.[N]
Let's go join the others.[A][X]

...Oh Helman, what have I[N]
gotten myself into now?[AN]
Fighting for the empire...[Beat][AN]

##JennySpawnText
[MidRight][LoadJenny]
[Beat]...There they are.[N]
The Liberators.[AN]
...I don't trust these[N]
empire goons. Can what they[N]
say really be true?[AN]
[Red]After what the Liberators[N]
did for my sis...[AN]
If they wanna talk, I[N]
should at least hear em' out.[Red][A][X]

[MidRight][LoadMeldan]
Oh me, oh my...[Beat][A]
The time has come.[AN]
...Oh, I can't do this![AN]
[Red]Not after what the[N]
rebels did for my friend![Red][AN]
Maybe I can sneak away...[Beat][AN]
The empire did say that the[N]
rebels were dangerous...[AN]
[Red]Can't let my guard down.[Red][A][X]

Liberators! Please, I[N] 
don't wanna fight.[AN]

highly of you.[AN]

Rebels! Oh, uh, Liberators![AN]
You've been rumored to be[N]
doing ill as of late![AN]
But my good friend Helman[N]
owes you a debt![AN]
So I shall be joining you,[N]
I shall help to set you straight![AN]
No need to thank me![A]
