# Some time passes; the group sails into port
and disembarks, meeting Trajan at the docks;
he's come along with Tao, who's hanging around
the port. Loewe exits first to speak to him,
but the group have a bit of an awkward silence.
Tao suddenly apologizes to Loewe for what
he did, asking him if he can ever forgive him
for what he's done. Loewe is initially silent,
but he admits that even if they didn't know,
the Liberators still share the blame for being
tricked. He calls it water under the bridge,
for which Tao is grateful. The boy admits that
he's not sure what to do anymore, given
that the only other people who he could blame,
Radnitz and Epony, are already dead. Loewe
tells him to pursue his own happiness,
as he has the freedom to do so. Tao thanks
him for the advice and leaves temporarily.

After that, Cleo and Kwame arrive. They tell
Trajan of their plans and get him up to
speed about all that's happened in Mahemen.
Although he is incredulous about all of it,
Trajan chooses to believe them. Kwame requests
that he offer them any aid that he can,
so he does the normal and tells them that
the port is filled with mercenaries and Liberators,
so they should hire two of them.
Loewe tells the two that he needs some time
to think and asks them to handle it.
After that, Cleo and Kwame decide on who to hire.

/*boat comes into shore; pans around the town,
showing all the people in the port; Loewe, on top
of the bow, sees Trajan and goes to greet him*/

Here we are, Cleo. Lazar once rivalled
Telyada as a trade center, but the
Cythean occupation ruined the city.
It's good to see the people standing
back on their feet again, isn't it?
[MidLeft]
...Yes, it is. It makes all
of our struggles, sacrifices,
and failures feel worth it.
[MidRight]
Now we just have to make sure they can
keep smiling. Hmm... I'll go look for
Trajan and fill him in on everything.
