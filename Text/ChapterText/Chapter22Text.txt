Say, you guys seem to be fighting out
there, what kind of group are ya?[A]
The liberators you say? Well, I've
got a bit of an offer for you.[A]
I'm a mercenary, been stuck up
here for so long with no work.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Everything is drying up in
Cythes, so I'm just pissing away
what little money I have left.[A]
So heres my offer, I'm good with
a sword, I can swipe anything you
need and I can pick any lock.[A]
All you need to do is pay me say
a paltry upfront sum of 800 gold
and I'm yours to command, whatcha say?[A]
