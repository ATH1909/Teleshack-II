[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You two are the Liberator commanders,[N]
right? I, Apsis, am just a[N]
humble traveling minstrel myself.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
A bard this far into our journey?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Even so, there has to be a reason[N]
Trajan chose him, right? That's a[N]
lot of tomes you carry there, Apsis.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I got a few[Beat] spell-twisting talents-[N]
It's a hobby of mine. Look,[N]
I've got nowhere else to be,[AN]
so how about you let me join your group?[AN][X]

## Ch18xApsisAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
Your sacrifices will not be in vain,[N]
liberators. [CloseEyes]Let faith guide our steps[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch18ApsisRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadApsis]
Tragic. So much untapped power[N]
and nothing to do with it.[A][X]

## Ch18xOjasviFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right]
You don't look like an ordinary soldier.[N]
You're from Mahemen, aren't you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's correct.[N]
I am Ojasvi Srivastana.[AN]
[FarRight]
A noble, eh? So, you were displaced[N]
during Cythes's invasion of Mahemen?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's right. Our family has proudly[N]
served the archbishops for generations.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah yes, now I recall. The Srivastana[N]
family is well-known for its mercantile[N]
empire. Particularly in the textiles,[AN]
if I am not mistaken.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That is correct.[N]
Did you know my father?[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] No.[AN]
[Right]
Never mind all that, why are you here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
When Cythes invaded, I was studying at[N]
an academy in the Empire. When I received[N]
word that Cythes invaded Mahemen[Beat][AN]
I fled to Decia. I did not want[N]
to see what would become of me, now[N]
that my homeland was their enemy.[AN]
I learned that my family's knights were[N]
deployed in the initial invasion,[N]
but were likely decimated.[AN]
I've yet to hear from my family,[N]
but I fear for the worst.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You don't seem too daunted[N]
by these uncertainties.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'd be lying if my heart didn't break[N]
not knowing their fate, but if they[N]
are dead[Beat] No, I shall not entertain it.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Quite an admirable spirit. But will[N]
your fortitude be enough to carry you?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I heard your group ventured to Mahemen[N]
and assisted in repelling the Cytheans.[N]
As thanks, I wish to lend you my blade.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Are you well-learned[N]
in the art of the sword?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] I've taken many lessons in fencing.[AN]
[Right]
But you've never seen true battle?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] No.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I doubt we can afford to take[N]
such a novice with us now.[N]
It may be too great a risk.[AN]
[FarRight]
I like her spirit, Cleo. She may[N]
be green, but nothing is more[N]
resolute than a purpose.[AN]
Perhaps she will surprise us.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Hmm[Beat][A][X]

## Ch18xOjasviAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Alright, Ojasvi.[N]
You may join us.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You will not regret this choice.[N]
My blade is yours.[N]
I will prove my worth yet.[A][X]

## Ch18OjasviRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadOjasvi][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Very well.[A][X]

## Ch18xZharaFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadZhara][ThreeLineBox]
Hail, friends! I see your quest takes[N]
you to places dire- exactly why[N]
you ought to let me come along![AN]
In Byelen's name, I've sworn to purge[N]
evil and guard the innocent, and[N]
my blade here allows me to do both![AN]
Er, not to say that I was[N]
officially ordained, but[Beat][N]
never mind, I said nothing.[A][X]

## Ch18xZharaAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadZhara][ToggleSmile]
Wonderful! You shan't[N]
regret this choice.[A][X]

## Ch18ZharaRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadZhara][ThreeLineBox]
Bah! If this be your wish,[N]
then I shall carve my own[N]
path to saving this world![AN][X]

## Ch18xDarcyFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right][OneLineBox]
So, what are you capable of?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Me? Well I been fightin' for[N]
House Freyse an' now the[N]
Liberators as a knight for years![AN]
I'm as reliable as you can get with[N]
my armour n' great ole' battle axe.[N]
Plus, armour don't slow me down too bad.[AN]
[FarRight]
Sorry, you said you're a knight?[N]
Forgive my questioning,[N]
but you sound very[Beat] rural.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Eh? Well, yea, I was raised a farm girl[N]
by my pa, but I always wanted ta be[N]
a knight, accent or no. An' besides,[AN]
voice ain't relevant to how[N]
I throw an axe about![AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Ah, I see. You're right, my apologies.[A]
[Right]
Is there anything else you can do?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, I can tend crops but that ain't[N]
what yer after. But hey, what more[N]
do ya need than a trained knight![AN]
I stayed alive this long[N]
and Trajan can back up my skill![AN]
[FarRight]
Well, that's pretty straightforward.[N]
No party tricks, but a good soldier is[N]
a good soldier. What do you say, Cleo?[A][X]

## Ch18xDarcyAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy][ThreeLineBox]
Heck yeah, you won't regret it![N]
I'll have my things ready faster[N]
than you can say fiddlesticks![A][X]

## Ch18xDarcyRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadDarcy][ThreeLineBox]
Ah well[Beat] I spose' I understand[Beat][N]
But, do let me know if[N]
you change your mind? Kay'?[AN][X]

## Ch18xGrotoFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Groto knows what you think.[N]
Cleo lady want to recruit Groto![AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Uh, what?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Groto smart, Groto read thoughts.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Sure, as if you know what[N]
I'm thinking right now.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo thinking Groto is lying[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
That's enough.[A][X]

## Ch18xGrotoAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You made up your mind![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I mean, sure,[N]
you might be an asset to us.[AN][X]

## Ch18xGrotoRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadGroto]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You don't want Groto? Groto sad.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] You already know[N]
that, then. Nevermind.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene1SacredArrowRebels
# Houvaina in a council room in Telyada, Kailani shows up
[MidLeft][LoadHouvaina]
[MidRight][LoadKailani]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, Kailani. I am glad to see[N]
you up and about, after[Beat][N]
what transpired before.[AN]
[MidRight]
Time stops for no one, so I cannot[N]
rest. Even if I never fight again,[N]
my duty to the rebellion remains.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It is good that you are spirited,[N]
because I have unfortunate news.[N]
Archbishop Mureib has passed on.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
No[Beat] How could this have happened?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The details are murky, but[Beat][N]
Survivors of his battalion claim[N]
that the Liberators did the deed.[AN]
These same soldiers also say that the[N]
Liberators took back Fort Kasira,[N]
moments before killing the archbishop.[AN]
We didn't learn of the news, not until[N]
after they had already returned to[N]
Telyada and sailed out of reach.[AN]
[MidRight]
What?! I cannot imagine that is true.[N]
They saved the Augur, took back[N]
Fort Kreiss and Kasira with haste,[AN]
and we are to believe they turned[N]
on us? There is more to this story,[N]
Archbishop Houvaina. There must be.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What are you insinuating?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]That Archbishop Mureib may have[N]
instigated this. I know it seems[N]
unthinkable, but consider this.[AN]
The Liberators risked their lives[N]
putting Wustheim within our reach,[N]
and Loewe personally saved my life.[AN]
Those are not the actions of traitors.[AN]
Mureib told us little of his past,[N]
so is it not possible they have a[N]
personal dispute of some sort?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]He did ask to speak to that man,[N]
Kwame, privately. I thought it odd[N]
at the time, but now, all the more.[AN]
[MidRight]
Exactly. We can always investigate[N]
this later, but I don't believe[N]
that the Liberators are a threat,[AN]
not to Mahemen. We have too much[N]
else to worry about, what with[N]
the escape of the Grimblade.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, so you've heard of her return[N]
to Telyada as well. My sworn sword[Beat][N]
Ha! She hid her true aims well from me.[AN]
[MidRight]
You cannot blame yourself, Houvaina.[N]
None of us could. In any case, is it[N]
true that she sails to Chouwouj?[AN]
[MidLeft]
So the rumors say. No one has seen[N]
her for long, but one of our rebels[N]
saw a woman matching her description.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] How odd. What could she possibly[N]
want there? Perhaps there is more[N]
happening than we know, in the shadows.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe so. What I would do for the[N]
Augur's guidance in this moment[Beat][N]
but she, too, has disappeared.[AN]
[MidRight]
It was wise to not tell the people[N]
of this, Houvaina. It would only[N]
cause them worry, I suspect.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, but we cannot hide it forever.[N]
[Beat]Do you think the Liberators[N]
kidnapped her? It seems possible.[AN]
[MidRight]
We have no way of knowing, but[N]
I would not doubt if she followed[N]
them willingly. Byelen's will[Beat][AN]
Even after all these years, it is[N]
incomprehensible to me. I only[N]
pray that her visions bode well.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As do I[Beat] In any case, we can wait[N]
to uncover this after we retake[N]
Wustheim with your help, Kailani.[AN]
Regardless of your new injuries,[N]
your foresight has always guided us,[N]
and we will have need of it again.[AN]
[MidRight]
If you will have me, then I vow to[N]
do all that I can. But once Wustheim[N]
rests in Mahemeni hands once more,[AN]
we must look without, rather than[N]
within. The storms of change blow[N]
wildly, and if we do not follow them,[AN]
their violent gales will scatter us,[N]
like arrows on the wind[Beat][A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat1
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
On the horizon, that must be[Beat][N]
Port Lazar? We near our destination,[N]
then. I should inform the others.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat2
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadElias]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Elias? What are you here for?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame wanted to hold a meeting[N]
to plan out our next move, now[N]
that we have Barod's cooperation.[AN]
He asked that I let you know.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Let's go, then.[N]
We musn't keep them waiting.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat3
# the two go down into a room on the boat, where Coralia, Kwame, Loewe, and Boro are waiting
[FarLeft][LoadElias]
[Left][LoadCoralia]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarRight]
Ah, Cleo. Excellent timing.[N]
How close are we to Freyse?[AN]
[Right]
By my estimate, an hour at most.[N]
We should prepare to depart.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. Though, there is one matter[N]
to discuss first, which is why I[N]
called this meeting. Lady Coralia,[AN]
are you certain you and Sir Elias[N]
must leave our company so soon?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, unfortunately. We have burdened[N]
you long enough, and there are matters[N]
in Cythes that require our attention.[AN]
Byelen's physical form, my grandfather's[N]
true aims, and the shadowy Lorekeepers[Beat][N]
There is too much to ignore in Cythes.[AN]
While you head for Chouwouj, we will[N]
investigate these matters and share[N]
whatever we learn when you arrive.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Right. Our route will take us northeast[N]
through the Decian Strait and around[N]
the northern edge of Cythean highlands.[AN]
Then, we'll hike through Mount Sarloos[N]
and make our way to the capital.[N]
I'd also like to deal with Kassandra,[AN]
but we have bigger problems than her.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Then we split at Port Lazar. Kwame,[N]
has Trajan responded to our message?[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed he has. Our pegasus rider[N]
just brought his reply back, and it[N]
seems he plans to see us off at port.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadBoro]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Trajan, eh? It's been a long[N]
time since I heard that name.[N]
Glad to hear he's still kicking.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
And you, Boro? You'll still[N]
travel with us to Chouwouj?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If you'll have me. I'm not sure[N]
how much use my spear will be,[N]
but I'll offer it all the same.[AN]
[Left]
Useful enough, given our circumstances.[N]
I still haven't fully forgiven you[N]
for abandoning us back in Decia,[AN]
but we can't afford to bicker over it,[N]
not with the stakes as high as they are.[AN]
[FarRight]
I agree. Not only must we find the[N]
sword and secure Taraji's cooperation,[N]
one way or another, but after that,[AN]
we still have to perform the ritual.[N]
For that, we must find our way into[N]
the Cythean palace in Gechrysos.[AN]
And of course, finding Catrin would[N]
help us, though I imagine we will[N]
find her not far from Taraji.[AN]
[Left]
Mom[Beat] I don't know why she left,[N]
but we have to find her before[Beat][N]
Before I lose her again.[A]
[Right]
We will Loewe, but first, this ritual[Beat][N]
Kwame, this required location bit is new.[N]
Why didn't you tell us this before?[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Mm[Beat] I apologize. It must[N]
have slipped my mind.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]In any case, it seems our choices[N]
are clear. We should gather our[N]
things and get ready to disembark.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'll help you out there, kid.[N]
I'm better suited to heavy[N]
lifting than you, anyhow.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat4
# boro and loewe leave; kwame prepares to leave
[MidRight][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
In that case, I will look over our[N]
stores. We'll need a clear idea of how
much food to purchase for the journey.[A][X]

## Ch18xBeginningScene2OnDaBoat5
[MidLeft][LoadCoralia]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadElias]
Lady Coralia, do you mind[N]
if I speak to Cleo, alone?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, not at all. Please[N]
excuse me, Elias, Cleo.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][Event]
[Right][MoveMidLeft]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What is it, Elias?[N]
We don't exactly have[N]
time for a nice chat.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you alright with this?[N]
Me leaving so soon, I mean.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That is your choice, not mine.[N]
It doesn't matter what I think,[N]
does it? It has to be done.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Right. Tell me something, Cleo.[N]
You told me that you wouldn't waver,[N]
and I don't doubt your words.[AN]
Still, if the ritual must be done[N]
in Cythes, then there's no getting[N]
around it. Our father awaits us.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What of it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Will your resolve stand firm,[N]
even if it means you must cut[N]
him down without any remorse?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If it allows us to perform the[N]
rites without any interruptions,[N]
then yes, I will do what I must.[AN]
Why the questions now, Elias?[N]
Have I not already shown my mettle?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You have, but killing one's kin[N]
is much worse than anything you've[N]
done. Are you sure you can handle it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I would rather avoid it, of course.[N]
Even so, Orodreth's fate rests on our[N]
shoulders. My emotions mean little,[AN]
in the face of such a burden. Father[Beat][AN]
would respect that, I think. I have[N]
fought, and fought, and fought,[N]
all so that I could become strong,[AN]
strong enough to protect everyone[N]
I care for. That was Father's advice,[N]
so he cannot blame me if I take it.[AN]
Any in our way will receive no quarter.[AN]
I may not be the Seed, or an immortal,[N]
or a princess, but even I have a role[N]
to play, and I cannot squander it.[AN]
Is that answer enough for you, Elias?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah, it is. Your resolve shines[N]
brighter than Argymos silver, Cleo.[N]
Seems my worries were for nothing.[AN]
Still, you're underselling your worth[N]
if you think that you're just playing[N]
a role. I know that better than anyone.[AN]
The Cleo back in the Cythean army[N]
would have never thought of standing[N]
against me, let alone her own father.[AN]
Maybe I'm biased, but from my own[N]
observations, the Liberators would[N]
have died ten times over without you.[AN]
You're more important to them than[N]
you know. I'm[Beat] I'm proud of you,[N]
of everything that you've become.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
W-What's with all the praise, Elias?[N]
You're not usually this sentimental.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I just thought I should get it off[N]
my chest while I still have the chance[N]
to say it. No knowing what'll happen.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Don't talk like that. We will meet[N]
again, understand? That's an order![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
If you say so, general, I'll make it[N]
happen. Still, I think that's enough[N]
of the sappy stuff for one day, right?[AN]
Let's get ready to arrive at the port.[N]
I'd bet Loewe still needs help,[N]
what with those spindly arms.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! Yes, you're probably right.[N]
We should give him a hand,[N]
lest he breaks his own trying.[AN][X]
