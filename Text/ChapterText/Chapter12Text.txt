[MidRight][LoadCidorYoung][CloseEyes]
Thanks be Byelen, whom has blessed us.[AN]
Thou who hast granted us water to drink,[N]
whom hast given us food to grow, [AN]
the very land to thrive on,[N]
thou to whom we art eternally greatful.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadDukeSelese]
Well said.[AN]
[MidRight]
May we begin eating father?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Before we do, Cidor,[AN]
I'm about about to tell you[N]
the most important lesson of your life;[AN]
the one that all your training and[N] 
education has lead up to.[AN]
If you remember nothing else,[N]
remember what I am about to tell you.[AN]
Are you ready?[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-yes father, I'm ready.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Our sole purpose in life is[N]
for the sake of our people.[AN]
We wield influence and power[N]
that decide who lives and dies.[AN]
We can do what no-one else can.[N]
We wield vicious might.[AN]
And it must be used for the good of all.[N]
Should you forget this...[AN]
Everything will have been for naught.[AN]
All your lessions, your education.[AN]
The triumphs and sacrifices of 
our ancestors before us.[AN] 
Byelen's bountiful miracles onto the world.[AN]
Our very lives.[AN]
All of it.[A] All of it will have[N]
been in vain.[AN]
Do you understand son?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Y-yes father, I understand.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Good. I'm proud of you Cidor.[AN]

*knocking*

???: Hello? Duke Selese?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah yes, right on time! Come in![A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadCidorYoung]
[Left][LoadDukeSelese]
[Left]
Welcome sir Athanasius!

???: "Sir Athanasius"? Bah, you know how little I care for formalities! 

[MidRight][LoadKwame]
You know I prefer Athan.[AN]
[Left]
Haha! Merely simple jest my friend![AN]
[MidRight]
Oh? Now who do we have here today?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Athan, I take it you ask out of formality?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, you must be the son of Duke Selese.[N]
A pleasure to meet you![AN]
[FarLeft]
It's nice to meet you too, Sir Athan.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Duke Selese, you know[N] 
why I am here today.[AN]
[Left]
Yes, I am aware. He is not here by mistake;[N]
he is of age.[AN] 
I think he is ready to be initiated.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, I see! Our meeting today will take[N]
a bit longer than usual. Very well![AN]
From this day forth, let it be[N]
known by Byelen himself,[AN]
that Prince Cidor is now an[N]
official member of the Lorekeepers![AN]
[FarLeft]
I swear I'll make you all proud![AN]
[MidRight]
I'm certain you will.[AN]
We have great hopes for you Cidor![A][X]

//the present
##Ch12BeginningScene2
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]and that's the truth Cidor.[AN]
The whole truth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're lying.[A] This is all[N]
a farce! A mockery![AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor[Beat] how I wish it was.[AN]
Neither of us can hide from[N]
the cruel reality of it all.[AN]
Cythes was using you.[AN]
The Lorekeepers were using you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It can't be![A] T-then that means[N]
the everything I did was[Beat][AN]
T-the amount of people that I[Beat] I[Beat][CloseEyes][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][CloseEyes][AN]
[MidLeft]
Decia[Beat] all of us[Beat] doomed[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry Cidor. I'm so so sorry.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH![AX]

--Cidor punches a hole in the wall--

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
//*hysterical noises in text form*
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
It's over Cidor. All that's[N]
left is to surrender now.[AN]
This meaningless infighting[N]
has to come to an end.[AN]
It'll all be ok.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]haha[Beat]ha[Beat]
[MidRight]
C-cidor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
ahh[Beat] hahaha[Beat] ahahaha![AN]
Oh Kwame, I'm the one who[N]
should be apologizing.[AN]
I almost gave into despair,[AN]
but the same cruel[N]
story that condemns us[AN]
also holds the key to our salvation.[AN] 
[MidRight]
[Beat]What are you talking about?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I was skeptical myself, and frankly,[N]
horrified to even try it.[AN]
But now I realize all along[N]
it was our only way out.[AN]

--Cidor reveals the legendary bow--
[MidRight]
!!! No! Why do you have that?![AN]

//screen fades to a black background. The ch8 boss's portrait shows up--
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[ToggleMouthMove][ThreeLineBox][MidLeft]
It's quite amazing what people[N]
will reveal after a couple of[N]
glasses of wine.[AN]
One of the captains stationed[N]
here from Cythes had passed[N]
it along to me.[AN]
She had found it in her travels,[N] 
taken from the clutches of an[N] 
"irresponsible runway princess".[AN]
She wished to have me relay it to[N] 
general Argymos, presumably because[N]
of his connection to the Lorekeepers.[AN]
[TwoLineBox]
And that's not all she passed on to me...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]


--screen fades back to the throne room--
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][Kwame]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]she also passed on the true might of this bow.[AN]
[MidRight]
No![A] Cidor, you musn't![AN]
[MidLeft]
The lost ritual will save Decia, Anthan.[AN] 
It will save Decia from the[N]
rebels and Cytheans alike.[AN] 
Many[Beat] will die today,[N] 
but many more will die if I don't act.[AX] 


//Guards and a noble rush in-
[Left][LoadCidor]
[FarLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right][LoadTiberius]
[FarRight][LoadSoldier]
[Right]
Uncle, what's wrong?![N]
We heard screaming and-[AN]
[Right]
What is that hole in the wall?![AN]
[Left]
Excellent timing! Guards, take our[N]
guest to his own holding cell.[AN]
[FarRight]
At once.[AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor stop! This isn't going[N]
to work the way you-[AN][X]

//Cidor ignores him, one of the guards begin to walk him away

[MidRight][LoadKwame]
Cidor! CIDOR![A][X]

--They go offscreen--

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][LoadTiberius]
[MidRight]
What's going on?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Nephew, inform the guards to move[N]
the prisoners to the center of the manse.[AN] 
We have grim work ahead of us tonight.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uncle what are-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Now.[AN]
[MidRight]
As you wish.[CloseEyes][A][X]

--A nearby stair tile get's highlighted--

//the scene with the Loewe and Cleo
Ch12BeginningScene

???(Loewe/Cleo): What? Are you serious? Mass execution?!

--Fade from black--
[MidRight][LoadMink]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight]
"Ritual sacrifice" would be more accurate,[N]
but in essence, yes.[AN]
Cidor plans to slaughter his[N]
wealth of prisoners tonight.[AN]
[Left]
Why?! 
[MidRight]
I[Beat] admit that the specifics escape me,[AN]
I could only overhear for a few moments[N]
after Cidor had Kwame taken away,[AN]
but he believes that he is performing a "ritual"[N]
that requires the sacrifice of many people.[AN]
One that he believes would have[N]
the power to "single-handedly save Decia".[AN]
[Left]
"Save Decia"?! That bastard![AN]
He's sent so many people to their[N]
deaths and he thinks he's saving Decia?![AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
I don't know if I can believe such a[N]
tall tale, why should we trust you?[AN]
You could easily be one of Cidor's[N]
minions leading us into a trap.[AN]
[MidRight][MidBlink][ThreeLineBox]
My my! I risk life and limb to[N]
deliver this information to you[N]
and I am rewarded with suspecion?[AN]
You wound my poor, fragile heart.[AN]
[Left][LoadLoeweAngry][TwoLineBox]
We don't have time to waste on someone[N]
who is just trying to screw with us![AN]
[MidRight]
It was but a jest; your suspicions[N]
are nothing but rational![A]
As a token of good faith, I shall[N]
reveal a bit about myself and Kwame.[AN]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
Go on.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame is a scholar of history,[N]
and I but his humble student.[AN] 
A student of history, and a[N]
little birdie that whispers[AN]
information into his ear[N] 
from time to time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Kwame has spies?[AN]
[MidRight]
That is a less than wholesome word,[AN] 
and I can't attest to whether he[N]
actually employs others like me,[AN] 
but yes, that would[N]
describe what I do.[AN]
[ThreeLineBox]
You don't think that your meeting[N] 
with him in Port Neufchatel[N]
was a coincidence do you?[AN]
You stired up quite the storm[N]
in the keep of "my good lord Cidor"[N]
a few months ago.[AN]
Kwame had been looking for an[N] 
opportunity to disrupt Cythe's[N] 
opperations in Decia,[AN]
and your group seemed[N]
like one who finally had[N] 
the mettle to do so.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Port Neufchatel[Beat]
I suppose Cidor wouldn't[N] 
have any way to know[AN] 
that we met Kwame there[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
How astute![AN]
And even if you didn't believe me,[AN]
Castle Selese is but a short[N]
distance away at this point.[AN]
You might as well strike[N]
while the iron is hot.[AN]

--Black background, Cleo and Mink disappear--

[Left] 
[ToggleMouthMove]This was planned? Spies?[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[Left][LoadLoeweAngry]
Kwame, what else are you hiding[N]
from us, you trecherous snake?![AN]

--Loewe and the background switch back to normal, Cleo and Mink reappear--

[Left][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadMink]
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Castle Selese was relatively[N]
undermanned and not bolstered[N]
by Cythean troops when I left;[AN]
I've heard that general Elias[N]
and much of Selese's remaining forces[N] 
were stationed in Raio Pass,[AN]
given that it's the main path[N]
into Selese from castle Freyese.[AN]
Cidor's actions and visit[N]
tonight seem impromtu.[AN]
I don't think they were aware[N]
of your current wereabouts.[AN]
In fact, even I'm quite shocked[N]
that your group even managed to[N]
reach here so quickly.[AN]
But I won't question it,[N]
it's only to our advantage.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Alright, I believe you.[AN]
Cleo, this might be our chance;[AN] 
we can finally purge Cythes[N]
from Decia once and for all.[AN]
I think we should go for it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm concerned, but what he's[N]
told us so far lines up.[AN]
I'm inclined to agree,[AN]
we might not get another[N]
chance like this.[AN]
Let's do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wonderful! Let us make haste,[N] 
time is of the essence.[AN]
Whether or not there is any merit[AN] 
to Cidor's theory that this[N]
ritual will be his salvation,[AN]
it changes nothing;[AN] 
he plans to slaughter[N]
countless innocents.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Agreed, Cidor's madness[N]
must come to an end.[AN]
[MidRight]
Let me join you on the battlefield.[N]
I don't like to get my hands dirty,[AN]
but when I do, I'm quite crafty.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We appreciate all the help we can get.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat][AN]

~~after scouting around~~
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight]
Let's split our forces on two fronts;[AN]
one comprised of cavarly[N]
to assault the outside,[AN]
and an infantry force[N]
to strike at the inside.[AN]
Does that sound good?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Loewe? Did you hear me?[N]
Are you ok?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sorry, I'm just a bit anxious.[AN]
I'll be fine. That sounds[N]
like a good idea.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's been a rough few months,[N]
but we're so close.[AN]
We can do this.[AN]
For Decia.[A] For everyone.[AN]
[Beat]for Dragana.[CloseEyes][AN]
[MidLeft]
Mhm. For Dragana[Beat][AN]

--Cleo leaves--

[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
Cidor, enjoy your last few moments.[AN]
The wolf will feast tonight; 
the earth running red with[N]
the blood of my prey.[AX]
