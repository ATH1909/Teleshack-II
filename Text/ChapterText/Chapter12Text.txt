[MidRight][LoadCidorYoung][CloseEyes]
Thanks be Byelen, whom has blessed us.[AN]
Thou who hast granted us water to drink,[N]
whom hast given us food to grow, [AN]
the very land to thrive on,[N]
thou to whom we art eternally greatful.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadDukeSelese]
Well said.[AN]
[MidRight]
May we begin eating father?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Before we do, Cidor,[AN]
I'm about about to tell you[N]
the most important lesson of your life;[AN]
the one that all your training and[N] 
education has lead up to.[AN]
If you remember nothing else,[N]
remember what I am about to tell you.[AN]
Are you ready?[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-yes father, I'm ready.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Our sole purpose in life is[N]
for the sake of our people.[AN]
We wield influence and power[N]
that decide who lives and dies.[AN]
We can do what no-one else can.[N]
We wield vicious might.[AN]
And it must be used for the good of all.[N]
Should you forget this...[AN]
Everything will have been for naught. 
All your lessions, your education.[AN]
The triumphs and sacrifices of 
our ancestors before us.[AN] 
Byelen's bountiful miracles onto the world.[AN]
Our very lives.[AN]
All of it.[A] All of it will have[N]
been in vain.[AN]
Do you understand son?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Y-yes father, I understand.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Good. I'm proud of you Cidor.[AN]

*knocking*

???: Hello? Duke Selese?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah yes, right on time! Come in![A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadCidorYoung]
[Left][LoadDukeSelese]
[Left]
Welcome sir Athanasius!

???: "Sir Athanasius"? Bah, you know how little I care for formalities! 

[MidRight][LoadKwame]
You know I prefer Athan.[AN]
[Left]
Haha! Merely simple jest my friend![AN]
[MidRight]
Oh? Now who do we have here today?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[Left]
Athan, I take it you ask out of formality?[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, you must be the son of Duke Selese.[N]
A pleasure to meet you![AN]
[FarLeft]
It's nice to meet you too, Sir Athan.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Duke Selese, you know[N] 
why I am here today.[AN]
[Left]
Yes, I am aware. He is not here by mistake;[N]
he is of age.[AN] 
I think he is ready to be initiated.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, I see! Our meeting today will take[N]
a bit longer than usual. Very well![AN]
From this day forth, let it be[N]
known by Byelen himself,[AN]
that Prince Cidor is now an[N]
official member of the Lorekeepers![AN]
[FarLeft]
I swear I'll make you all proud![AN]
[MidRight]
I'm certain you will.[AN]
We have great hopes for you Cidor![A][X]

//the present
##Ch12BeginningScene2
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]and that's the truth Cidor.[AN]
The whole truth.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're lying.[A] This is all[N]
a farce! A mockery![AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor[Beat] how I wish it was.[AN]
Neither of us can hide from[N]
the cruel reality of it all.[AN]
Cythes was using you.[AN]
The Lorekeepers were using you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It can't be![A] T-then that means[N]
the everything I did was[Beat][AN]
Decia[Beat] All of us[Beat] doomed[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
I'm sorry Cidor. I'm so so sorry.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][Beat]
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH![AX]

--Cidor punches a hole in the wall--

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
//*hysterical noises in text form*
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
It's over Cidor. All that's[N]
left is to surrender now.[AN]
This meaningless infighting[N]
has to come to an end.[AN]
It'll all be ok[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]haha[Beat]ha[Beat]
[MidRight]
C-cidor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
ahh[Beat] hahaha[Beat] ahahaha![AN]
Oh Kwame, I'm the one who[N]
should be apologizing.[AN]
I almost gave into despair,[AN]
but the same cruel[N]
story that condemns us[AN]
also holds the key to our salvation.[AN] 
[MidRight]
[Beat]What are you talking about?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I was skeptical myself, and frankly,[N]
horrified to even try it.[AN]
But now I realize all along[N]
it was our only way out.[AN]

--Cidor reveals the legendary bow--
[MidRight]
!!! No! Why do you have that?![AN]

//screen fades to a black background. The ch8 boss's portrait shows up--
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[ToggleMouthMove][ThreeLineBox][MidLeft]
It's quite amazing what people[N]
will reveal after a couple of[N]
glasses of wine.[AN]
One of the captains stationed[N]
here from Cythes had passed[N]
it along to me.[AN]
She had found it in her travels, 
taken from the clutches of 
an "irresponsible runway princess" she told me. 
She wished to relay it to general Argymos, 
presumably because of his connection to the Lorekeepers.
[TwoLineBox]
And that's not all she passed on to me...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]


--screen fades back to the throne room--
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][Kwame]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]she also passed on the true might of this bow.[AN]
[MidRight]
No! Cidor, you musn't![AN]
[MidLeft]
The lost ritual will save Decia, Anthan. 
It will save Decia from the liberators and Cytheans alike. 
Many[Beat] will die today, but many more will die if I don't do this. 

//Guards and a noble rush in-
[Left][LoadCidor]
[FarLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right][LoadTiberius]
[FarRight][LoadSoldier]
[Right]
Uncle, what's wrong?![N]
We heard screaming and-[AN]
[Right]
What is that hole in the wall?![AN]
[Left]
Excellent timing! Guards, take our[N]
guest to his own holding cell.[AN]
[FarRight]
At once.[AN]
[MidRight]
Cidor stop! This isn't going[N]
to work the way you-[AN][X]

//Cidor ignores him, one of the guards begin to walk him away

[MidRight][LoadKwame]
Cidor! CIDOR![A][X]

--They go offscreen--

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][LoadTiberius]
[MidRight]
What's going on?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Nephew, inform the guards to move[N]
the prisoners to the center of the manse.[AN] 
We have grim work ahead of us tonight.[AN]
[MidRight]
Uncle what are-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Now.[AN]
[MidRight]
As you wish.[CloseEyes][A][X]
