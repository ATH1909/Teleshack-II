Thanks be Byelen, whom has blessed us.[AN]
Thou who hast granted us water to drink,[N]
whom hast given us food to grow, [AN]
the very land to thrive on,[N]
thou to whom we art eternally greatful.[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidLeft][LoadDukeSelese]
Well said.[AN]
[MidRight]
May we begin eating father?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Before we do, Cidor,[AN]
I'm about about to tell you[N]
the most important lesson of your life;[AN]
the one that all your training and[N]
education has lead up to.[AN]
If you remember nothing else,[N]
remember what I am about to tell you.[AN]
Are you ready?[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-yes father, I'm ready.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Our sole purpose in life is[N]
for the sake of our people.[AN]
We wield influence and power[N]
that decide who lives and dies.[AN]
We can do what no-one else can.[N]
We wield vicious might.[AN]
And it must be used for[N]
the good of all.[AN]
Should you forget this[Beat][AN]
Everything will have[N]
been for naught.[AN]
All your lessions, your education.[AN]
The triumphs and sacrifices of[N]
our ancestors before us.[AN]
Byelen's bountiful miracles[N]
onto the world.[AN]
Our very lives.[AN]
All of it.[AN]
All of it will[N]
have been in vain.[AN]
Do you understand son?[AN]

It's quite amazing what people[N]
will reveal after a couple of[N]
glasses of wine.[AN]
One of the captains stationed[N]
here from Cythes had passed[N]
it along to me.[AN]
She had found it in her travels,[N]
taken from the clutches of an[N]
"irresponsible runway princess".[AN]
She wished to have me relay it to[N]
general Argymos, presumably because[N]
of his connection to the Lorekeepers.[AN]
And that's not all she passed on to me[Beat][AN]

The lost ritual will save Decia, Anthan.[AN]
It will save Decia from the[N]

[MidRight]
"Ritual sacrifice" would[N]
be more accurate,[AN]
but in essence, yes.[AN]
Cidor plans to slaughter his[N]
wealth of prisoners tonight.[AN]
[Left]
Why?![AN]
[MidRight]
I admit that the specifics escape me,[AN]
I could only overhear for a few moments[N]
after Cidor had Kwame taken away,[AN]
but as I said, he believes that[N]
he is performing a "ritual".[AN]
One that he believes would have[N]
the power to "single-handedly save Decia".[AN]
[Left][LoadLoeweAngry]
"Save Decia"?! That bastard![AN]
He's sent so many people to their[N]
deaths and he thinks he's saving Decia?![AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
I don't know if I can believe such a[N]
tall tale,[A] why should we trust you?[AN]
You could easily be one of Cidor's[N]
minions leading us into a trap.[AN]
[MidRight][MidBlink][ThreeLineBox]
My my! I risk life and limb to[N]
deliver this information to you[N]
and I am rewarded with suspecion?[AN]
You wound my poor, fragile heart.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
We don't have time to waste on someone[N]
who is just trying to screw with us![AN]
[MidRight]
It was but a jest; your suspicions[N]
are nothing but rational![AN]
As a token of good faith, I shall[N]
reveal a bit about myself and Kwame.[AN]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
Go on.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame is a scholar of history,[N]
and I but his humble student.[AN]
A student of history, and a[N]
little birdie that whispers[AN]
information into his ear[N]
from time to time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Kwame has spies?[AN]
[MidRight]
That is a less than wholesome word,[AN]
and I can't attest to whether he[N]
actually employs others like me,[AN]
but yes, that would describe what[N]
I do for him.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[ThreeLineBox]
[MidRight]
You don't think that your meeting[N]
with him in Port Neufchatel[N]
was a coincidence do you?[AN]
You stired up quite the storm[N]
in the keep of "my good lord Cidor"[N]
a few months ago.[AN]
Kwame had been looking for an[N]
opportunity to disrupt Cythe's[N]
opperations in Decia,[AN]
and your group seemed[N]
like one who finally had[N]
the mettle to do so.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Port Neufchatel[Beat][AN]
I suppose Cidor wouldn't[N]
have any way to know[AN]
that we met Kwame there[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
How astute![AN]
And even if you didn't[N]
believe me,[AN]
Castle Selese is but a short[N]
distance away at this point.[AN]
You might as well strike[N]
while the iron is hot.[AN]

[Event]//Loewe and the background switch back to normal, Cleo and Mink reappear
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadMink]
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Castle Selese was relatively[N]
undermanned and not bolstered[N]
by Cythean troops when I left;[AN]
I've heard that general Elias and[N]
a gaggle of Selese's remaining forces[N]
were stationed in Raio Pass,[AN]
given that it's the main path[N]
into Selese from castle Freyese.[AN]
Cidor's actions and visit[N]
tonight seem impromtu.[AN]
I don't think they were aware[N]
of your current wereabouts.[AN]
In fact, even I'm quite shocked[N]
that your group even managed to[N]
bypass the pass.[AN]
But I won't question it,[N]
it's only to our advantage.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I believe you.[AN]
Cleo, this might be our chance![AN]
We can finally purge Cythes[N]
from Decia once and for all.[AN]
I think we should go for it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm concerned, but what he's[N]
told us so far lines up.[AN]
I'm inclined to agree,[AN]
we might not get another[N]
chance like this.[AN]
Let's do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wonderful! Let us make haste,[N]
time is of the essence.[AN]
Whether or not there is any merit[AN]
to Cidor's theory that this[N]
ritual will be his salvation,[AN]
it changes nothing;[AN]
he plans to slaughter[N]
countless innocents.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Agreed, Cidor's madness[N]
must come to an end.[AN]
[MidRight]
Let me join you on the battlefield.[N]
I don't like to get my hands dirty,[AN]
but when I do, I'm quite crafty.[AN]

worry about now.[AN]

What's this?[AN]
[Right]
The soliders who didn't get[N]
away or die in the fighting.[AN]
They've surrendered.[A] We have to[N]

They helped him butcher[N]
countless people![AN]
[MidLeft]
What's the point?![AN]
The fighting is over,[N]
Cidor is dead![AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
There has to be justice Cleo![MidRight][N]
For all the suffering he caused![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We didn't bleed and fight[N]
all this time just to replace[N]
one tyrant with another![AN]
Now's the time to be[N]
better than he was,[N]
we have to be merciful![AN]
[MidRight]
Mercy?[A] What about all[N]
the countless people[N]
who Cidor oppressed?[AN]
The ones he slaughtered[N]
tonight in his[N]
twisted ritual?[AN]
All the people in the[N]
resistance who died[N]
fighting him?[AN]
What about Dragana?![AN]
Did he show mercy[N]
to any of them?![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][CloseEyes]
Don't you dare Loewe[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]//use angry portrait
Don't you DARE use her name to[N]
justify what you're doing![AN]
She's the last person who[N]
would've wanted this![AN]
[MidRight]
What do you know about her?![AN]
I've been with her[N]
since the beginning![AN]
I've known her since[N]
I was a child,[AN]
when your country[N]
burned down my village![AN]

[Event]//silence music

let me live.[AN]
She would've let me be put[N]
down, like I deserved.[AN]

What?[AN]
[Event]//song to FF6 awakening
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] hurt so many people Loewe.[AN]

with what Cythes was doing.[AN]
I should've stood up to them,[N]
but I didn't.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
One day, the resistance[N]
ambushed us.[AN]
We were no match for them.[AN]
I froze.[A] I couldn't lift[N]
a finger against them.[AN][CloseEyes]
In the terror of combat,[N]
I[Beat] I also felt relieved.[AN]
I didn't care whether[N]
I lived or died,[AN]
I just didn't want to[N]
hurt anyone else anymore.[AN][OpenEyes]
When the fighting was over,[N]
they found me.[AN]
They wanted to execute me.[AN]
[MidRight]

[MidRight][LoadLoewe]//use loewe crying
Cidor[Beat] took so much from me[Beat][AN]
I wanted to make hurt him so badly,[AN]
I wanted to make him pay.[AN]
It was the only thing[N]
keeping me going.[AN]
I was so close,[AN]
only for him to slip out of[N]
my fingers at the last second.[AN][CloseEyes]
I miss Dragana so much Cleo.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]

[MidRight][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox][CloseEyes]
They're just children, they[N]
shouldn't have to be fighting[N]
just for the right to exist.[AN]
[Beat]I can't tell them everything[N]
I told Cidor,[A] it'd drive them to[N]
grief and despair like it did him.[AN]
Who knows what they'd do.[AN][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Just enough.[A] I just have to tell[N]
enough to satisfy them.[AN]
Enough to seek out the weapons.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
All this suffering[Beat][AN]
all because of the greed of a few.[A][X]

done the same.[A][X]

You made this mess, the[N]
least you can all do is[N]
help clean it up.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
I'll make it right.[N]
I have to.[AN][CloseEyes]
No matter the cost.[A][X]
