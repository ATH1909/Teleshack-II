[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Huff[Break][....] Huff[Break][....] I think-[....] I think[N] 
we're clear of them.[A]
[FarLeft] 
We're just lucky Boro had a[N]
change of heart when he did[Break][A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
How are you feeling General?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Hah, it'll take more than this[N]
to put me out of commission.[N]
But I have to say, thank you all,[AN]
normally I would reprimand[N]
this kind of foolishness but-[....][N]
you've done a fine job.[A]
[FarLeft]
We're not exactly out of the[N]
woods so I wouldn't thank[N]
us yet, this place is a maze.[A]
[Left]
Of course, no doubt every soldier[N] 
Cidor has is after us.[N]
Do we have an escape plan?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Not exactly but I think[N]
Varga might know.[A]

[Right][ThreeLineBox]
If we can get through here,[N]
we should be able to[N]
make a break for it.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
You're sure about this Varga?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Not exactly, there will[N]
be plenty of guards.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You're sure we can trust this guy[N]
Cleo? I mean he was awful keen[N] 
to turn on his former allies.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm certain, trust me on this.[N]
I'll explain it all later.[A]
[FarLeft]
Yeah, I trust you, alright then.[N]
Well I think no matter what we do[N]
we're going to run into soldiers,[AN]
so I don't see anything wrong[N]
with Varga's proposal. General?[A]
[Left]
If we can get the drop on them we[N]
should be able to push through[N]
before they can react,[AN]
but we'll have to be fast if we[N]
want everyone to escape. But[N]
that should be no trouble for you.[N]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Alright then, if theres no[N]
objections, lets move.[A][X]

They must have gotten through[N]
Boro. what do we do?[A]
We can't just leave him after[N]
he did that for us[Break][A]
[MidRight]
We have to push on, it's too[N]
late to turn around now![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
But he-[A]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][FarFarLeft][LoadDragana][MoveMidLeft]

[MidLeft]
Wh- Alex, Axel? What on earth[N]
are you two doing in here?[A]
[Right]
Ah boss, we can explain!
[FarRight]
We came in to help you[N]
guys out but, well-[A]
[Right]
We might've gotten found out, oops.[A]
[MidLeft]
Idiots! You were supposed to stay[N]
with the rest of the squad![A]
[FarRight]
Yeah but they're fine on their own outside![A]
[Right]
And you guys probably needed the help more![A]
[MidLeft]
Thats not the point! What if we hadn't come this way?[N]
You'd be rotting in Cidors jail for the rest of your days.[A]
And I don't think you'd be any use to us like that![A]
[Right]
Yeah but we aren't and thats what matters![A]
[FarRight]
And now we can help you out![A]
[MidLeft]
Sometimes I wonder how I ever let[N]
you two onto the recon squad[Break][A]
[FarRight]
I mean you need someone who can[N]
handle themselves in a brawl.[A]
[Right]
It's not like Iskra is going toe to toe[N]
with a knight in a one versus one swordfight.[A]
[FarRight]
And we're two for the price of one![A]
[MidLeft]
Hah, whatever you two knuckleheads.[N]
Come on, do what you do best, let's move![A]
[Right]
[MoveRight]
Aye aye cap'n![A]

[MidLeft]
You really thought you could slip out[N]
from under me just like that?[A]
[Right]
But of course, how hard could it be?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hmph. Your blasted rebellion has been a thorn in[N]
my side long enough. I'm putting an end to[N]
this pointless conflict here and now, today.[A]
[FarRight]
Cidor! Don't you see the harm this[N]
is doing to our country? Why do you-[A]
[MidLeft]
Enough of your political drivel, you[N]
don't even understand what you're.[N]
fighting against I do what I must for Decia.[A]
[FarRight]
Even if that amounts to killing your own[N]
countrymen? Letting Cythes stomp all over us?[N]
Just that you might become their favourite pet?[A]
[MidLeft]
You know nothing of what I work towards, why[N]
I do this. But enough Kasun, this ends here[N]
your 'liberation' shall fall with you![A]
[FarRight]
Pah, like I'd fall to a traitorous swine like you![A]
