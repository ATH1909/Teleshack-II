## Ch25Objective
Defeat Cherne[X]

## RunningOutOfCatacombs
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft]
Huff[Beat]huff[Beat][N]
I can see a light[Beat][A]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Yes[Beat]just a little[Beat]further[Beat][A][X]

## OutOfCatacombs
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Gah, that's bright.[N]
Where[Beat]are we? [AN]
This isn't where[N]
we entered the catacombs.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We[Beat]appear to have come out in the [N]
southern part of Gechrysos.[N]
I can see the castle there to the north.[A]
[MidLeft]
Okay[Beat] so what's our next move?[AN]
I heard the footsteps behind us[N]
stop at some point,[AN]
so we should have a moment,[N]
but[Beat] Gods, did that really just happen?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]It did. Cherne[Beat][N]
was playing us the whole time.[A]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes]I just- this was supposed[N]
to be over! I don't[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
[OpenEyes]I think[Beat] our best move right now would[N]
be to link up with the Mahemeni army. [AN]
By now they should have broken through[N]
the southern wall, and might arrive shortly.[A]
[MidLeft]
[OpenEyes]Yeah, that's a good plan. [N]
Lemme see if I can spot them from the air[Beat][AN]
That's strange. I can hear bells, faintly. [A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I can hear them too. So distant,[N]
but it's definitely bells. Is this because[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I guess I've cursed us all to hear this[N]
melody forever[Beat][AN]
It's actually somewhat pleasant. [N]
None of the harsh clangs from before.[AN]
Maybe it's because Byelen's power[N]
itself has been transformed.[A]
[MidRight]
Okay, if it's benign, then we can ignore[N]
it for now.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Right. Just one second[Beat][A][X]

## SeeingMahemenGetOwned
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh.[A] Oh no.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What is it?[N]
Have they not broken through yet?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Worse. They did break through.[N]
Even made it to the palace.[A][X]

## MahemenGetsOwned
[FarLeft][LoadKailani]
[Left][LoadHouvaina]
[MidRight][LoadCherne]
[Left][OneLineBox]
What[Beat]what is this?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This is insanity[Beat][AN]
how are these civilians [N]
fighting like hardened soldiers?![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, that's because I've been[N]
endowing them with a millennium's[N]
worth of combat experience. [AN]
It was a tricky spell to perfect,[N]
especially with Byelen's crude work,[N]
but it's quite appropriate, no?[AN]
After all, are these not the people of[N]
the great Cythean Empire,[N]
whose pride is their military's strength?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Kwame, you[Beat] I don't understand?[N]
You were the one instigating all this?[AN]
Was Mureib[Beat]right?[N]
And that sword[Beat]isn't that[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]There's quite a lot you've missed, [N]
Archbishop. But no need to worry. [AN]
All you need to know is that your death [N]
will be a stepping stone to [N]
a glorious future.[A][X]

## HouvainaGetsABlister
[MidLeft][LoadHouvaina]
[Left]
Gaaah[Beat]I[Beat]Graaah![A][X]

## KailaniMustMakeHerRetreat
[MidLeft][LoadKailani]
[Left]
Oh gods[Beat][N]
Everyone, retreat! Immediately![A][X]

## CherneHasAMoment
[MidLeft][LoadCherne]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
That woman really managed to use[N]
Rewarp while being impaled?[N]
I'm actually impressed.[AN]
Bah. No matter. The mistake of[N]
her survival will be rectified shortly,[AN]
and she left me with the greater[N]
prize of these new bodies[Beat][A][X]

## MahemeniReunionConvoOne
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadKailani]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Archbishop Kailani![N]
I saw what happened,[N]
we're getting hel-[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You! Stay where you are,[N]
traitorous snake![A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Please, I know this isn't what you[N]
expected, but the Archbishop needs[N]
aid![AN]
If[Beat]if we were with Kwame,[N]
wouldn't we just want to let her die?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Fine. but I shall be [N]
watching if this is a trick.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you.[A][X]

## MahemeniReunionConvoTwo
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadKailani]
[Right][LoadHouvaina]
[Right]
Agh[Beat]that's better.[N]
N-not much better,[AN]
but I'm glad to know[N]
that I'll not be dying just yet.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Not that much of a reprieve,[N]
if all that Cleo and Loewe[N]
have said is true.[AN]
This story is beyond credulity,[N]
but I can't deny what I saw[Beat][AN]
what else beyond a god's power could[N]
bring forth such a mass resurrection,[AN]
and turn normal people into[N]
instant warriors?[A]
[FarLeft]
To be clear, he is in[N]
human form right now. [AN]
Most of his power must not[N]
be available to him.[AN]
Details about Cherne are sparse,[N]
as you might expect,[AN]
but if he truly had access to[N]
all his divine might,[AN]
from what I recall,[AN]
he would need no army of thralls[N]
to enact his extermination.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
So all he has right now are whatever[N]
magicks his mortal form can handle,[AN]
and his knowledge as the first[N]
and greatest mage.[Beat]And his new army.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I think he might've harnessed[N]
something from Kaiserschwert too.[N]
It feels different. Lesser, somehow.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Perhaps he managed to tap into what[N]
remains of the Immortals' blessing?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Would make sense. I suppose this[N]
isn't exactly very useful to us, then.[AN]
Kaiserschwert is now a blade with[N]
power against literally everyone[N]
except for our enemy.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
It's strange though[Beat][AN]
Even knowing that the sword isn't[N]
essential to his plans, [AN]
he didn't try very hard to [N]
prevent our retreat. [AN]
Is there something we missed?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]The bodies. Our army was torn apart,[N]
and if he could bring back all those[N]
Cytheans, perhaps he could do it again.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then[Beat]we must stop him immediately![AN]
If he grows his army further,[AN]
we'll be faced with an[N]
insurmountable force![AN]
All of Orodreth will join his hordes,[N]
and then be sacrificed![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
This[Beat] this is my fault. [A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Loewe?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I really thought I was doing something right,[N]
trying to make my own choice[Beat][AN]
And instead hundreds of Mahemeni[N]
lie dead and a maniac is going to kill us all.[AN]
I[Beat]how stupid was I, to think that I had found[N]
a perfect solution to everything!?[AN]
That such a thing could even exist![AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Loewe! For gods' sake![A][X]

## CleoGazesIntoTheAbyss
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat]sorry. The last thing we[N]
need is useless self pity.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[CloseEyes]
No. Look, I get it. We've fought so hard,[N]
come so far, and yet things[N]
seem bleaker than ever.[AN]
Today's already pushed me to my limits,[N]
and I'm not the one who[N]
had to destroy a god.[AN]
Now we're facing someone we trusted,[N]
who's been with is through so much.[AN]
My body is screaming at me to give in,[N]
to let rest and oblivion take me.[AN]
You[Beat]you already know I've made so[N]
many wrong choices, and those regrets[N]
will stick with me forever, probably.[AN]
I[Beat]I won't lie. Part of me is tempted to[N]
let Cherne take me. I'm so tired.[N]
I've ruined so much. So why not?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[OpenEyes]
But. The rest of me knows better. [AN]
Your choice had a consequence[N]
that you didn't expect, [AN]
but even if you could have somehow[N]
seen Cherne's betrayal coming,[AN]
it doesn't change the fact that[N]
it's never wrong to take charge[N]
of your own destiny.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I understand what you're trying[N]
to say, but look at what's happened-[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[OpenQuote]We must always look forward.[AN]
We can't stay stuck in the past anymore.[AN]
We have to[Beat] find our own future[Beat][N]
and claim it with our own two hands."[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The man who said this just a short[N]
while ago wasn't wrong.[AN]
What happened, happened.[AN]
Now we have to face what comes next.[N]
That's[Beat]just how life is.[AN]
Besides, I doubt going with Cherne's plan[N]
would have fared much better.[AN]
What would a world ruled by a being who[N]
could slaughter a continent look like?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Heh[Beat]you're right. Completely. [N]
You've always been a step[N]
ahead of me, Cleo.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I wouldn't say that. It took me this[N]
long to face my father and the wretched[N]
things he stood for, after all.[AN]
And I wouldn't have gotten this far[N]
without you and everyone else.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Unfortunate thing about us humans, huh?[N]
We're no good without each other.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Heh. Glad to see you're[N]
over your funk, then.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah. Okay, back to the situation at hand.[N]
We need to strike as soon as we can,[AN]
but still, it's going to be a tough fight,[N]
with those troops he has[Beat][A][X]

## ByelenReturnsToMindDungeon
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][ToggleColorInvert]
Heh[Beat] glad she snapped you out of it.[AN]
It'd be quite ridiculous for you to[N]
collapse into a panic here.[AN]
And embarrassing for me.[A][ToggleColorInvert]
[MidLeft]
That[Beat]that voice![AN]
But[Beat]how?[N]
You should be gone! Dispersed![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleColorInvert]
Sigh[Beat]I am gone. I must hand it to you.[N]
You did quite a number on me. [AN]
Even mine divine self can't hold itself[N]
together with how thoroughly[N]
you've splintered me.[A]
[ToggleColorInvert]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
But then[Beat]who[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleColorInvert]
You're talking to a tiny fragment.[AN]
Originally I was just going to make[N]
some ominous statement about my[N]
inevitable return before I faded away,[AN]
and leave you paranoid[N]
for the rest of your life.[AN]
It would have been very entertaining.[N]
But, it seems like you could use a bit of help.[A]
[ToggleColorInvert]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You're[Beat]going to help me?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleColorInvert]
Don't misunderstand, boy. I'm not[N]
exactly happy about being murdered.[AN]
On the other hand, I'm even less[N]
happy about the thought of my[N]
brother stealing my power,[AN]
even if I'm[Beat] already dead.[AN]
I suppose you may see this as one[N]
last way to protect what's become of me.[A]
[ToggleColorInvert]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleColorInvert]
Don't strain yourself. We both know[N]
you've no regrets about slaying me.[A]
[ToggleColorInvert]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat]I really don't.[N]
So then[Beat]what's this help?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleColorInvert]
Open your eyes, and listen to the melody.[N]
Oh[Beat]and I suppose those four might be[N]
of assistance to you too. Goodbye, Loewe.[AN]
Make sure humanity doesn't[N]
squander my power.[A]

Loewe![A][X]

## KaiserschwertDoesTheThing
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, what's going on?[N]
You spaced out, and now[N]
Kaiserschwert is glowing![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat]Ah![A][X]

## FourImmortalsAppear
[FarLeft][LoadBarod]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
We're[Beat]free?[A]
[Left][LoadTaraji][TwoLineBox]
Good. I couldn't stand another[N]
moment in there with you louts.[A]
[FarRight][LoadMureib][OneLineBox]
Hmph. As if you made better company.[A]
[Right][LoadAthanasius]
[Beat][A][X]

## TalkingToTheGotohs
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I- Did[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I guess[Beat]this is what he[N]
meant by those four[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you talking about?[N]
Who said that?[A]
[Left]
I'll[Beat]explain it later.[N]
Barod, we need help-[A]
[Right][LoadBarod]
No need to explain, Loewe.[N] 
We know exactly what happened.[A]
[FarLeft]
You're aware of the outside[N]
world in the sword?[A]
[Right]
Yeah, to a certain extent.[AN]
It's a little hard to explain[N]
the sensations, but[Beat][AN]
Well, it doesn't really matter. Ugh[Beat][A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat]? Something wrong?[A]
[FarRight][LoadMureib][ThreeLineBox]
Our blessings[Beat] have dissipated.[N]
It seems[Beat] our graves have[N]
gotten quite impatient.[A]
[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadTaraji][TwoLineBox]
Pah[Beat] This is nothing.[N]
I've faced worse[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
How[Beat]how long do you think you have?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Hours, perhaps? Possibly even a day?[N]
It makes no difference to me.[AN]
If oblivion has finally seen fit to claim me,[N]
I have no intent of stopping it.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
What a worthless way to think.[AN]
Well, if you wish to simply stand there[N]
and wait to die, I'll not stop you.[AN]
But I, Taraji, will not accept such[N]
a ignominious end! You, boy![AN]
You still owe me a proper duel.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
![A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]But it seems that will have to wait.[AN]
After all, I also owe that bastard[N]
Cherne an appointment with my blades.[AN]
To think he had me fooled for so[N]
long[Beat]Graah! My blood boils.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Wait- You're going to help us fight him?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Close that gaping mouth, girl. You've[N]
hardly changed my mind about the[N]
righteousness of my cause.[AN]
But if this is to be my last day, then[N]
it shall be remembered as the day the[N]
Pitviper's venom took down a god![AN]
Of course, if you have an issue with[N]
fighting by my side, then I'm sure[N]
we could[Beat]resolve it.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I suppose[Beat]we do need[N]
every hand we can get.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
And frankly, we have better things[N]
to do than fight you again.[A]
[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadBarod][ThreeLineBox]
I don't think I need to say that[N]
I'll be fighting too. I was already[N]
prepared for the end when I came,[AN]
and although I wasn't in the blade[N]
as long as you three,[N]
I owe Cherne payback too.[A]
[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadAthanasius][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
You're[Beat] Athanasius, right?[N]
The real one?[AN]
I can't even begin to imagine[N]
what you've been through.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Don't bother trying to speak to him.[AN]
A millennium of solitude has[N]
shattered his mind,[N]
from what I can tell.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
How[Beat] awful. Cherne has one[N]
more life to pay for, then.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]nge[Beat][A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Did[Beat]he say something?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
R[Beat]nge[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat]can't tell what he's mumbling[Beat][A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Revenge! I will[Beat]Revenge![A]
[Left]
Oh. Sir, we-[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Days, months, years![N]
I scream into the darkness![N]
I beat against my chains![AN]
I must kill the jailer![AN]
Rip off his limbs,[N]
cut out his eyes,[N]
strangle him with his intestines![AN]
Graaaah![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]?[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Right][OneLineBox]I will[Beat]have revenge[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I think we can at least point him[N]
in the right direction in battle.[N]
Let's just[Beat]try to stay out of his way.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Agreed.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Alright, so you three'll[N]
fight alongside us, Mureib[Beat][A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I have no interest in wasting my[N]
time [OpenQuote]saving" a world I won't see,[N]
and I don't need your protection, girl.[AN]
I'll stay out of your way, so you[N]
need not concern yourself with me.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Fine then. Do as you wish with[N]
your remaining time. Moving on,[N]
wait[Beat]where's Kaiserschwert?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
You dropped it right[Beat]there.[N]
Is that[Beat]a bell?[A][X]

## WoahTheBellOfByelen
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yeah, it is. I feel different while[N] 
holding it. Swifter, or something.[AN]
And the chimes[Beat]are louder. [N]
But seriously, a bell? [AN]
He's[Beat]really something.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I have yet more questions I suppose[N]
will have to be answered later.[N]
I guess you can just hold onto it, then.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hang on, can you try holding it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sure. [Beat]Huh.[N]
That does feel strange.[AN]
The bells were so faint until I[N]
picked it up, but[N]
now they echo so loudly.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I guess those clangs and chimes that[N]
are part of all us now[Beat][N]
are being powered up?[AN]
So anyone can hold this.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]We can puzzle it out later.[N]
For now, it's one more tool.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Right. [AN]
We oughtn't give Cherne more time.[AN]
We need to rally everyone,[N]
for this one final fight.[A][X]

## EpicSpeechOfEpicness
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Alright, we're just about ready.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Ugh, it's speech time, isn't it?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Well, you don't have to. I can-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No[Beat] I'll do it. Ahem. [AN]
My allies, my friends![AN]
Although we bear the name[N]
[OpenQuote]Decian Liberators", that moniker[N]
has become obsolete![AN]
We hail from everywhere from[N]
Chouwouj to Mahemen![AN]
We even boast Cytheans[N]
among our numbers![AN]
All of us stand united for one purpose:[N]
to oppose oppression,[N]
whatever the form it takes![AN]
To liberate not just Decia, but all[N]
of Orodreth from tyrants' hands,[N]
even if it be a god's![AN]
Our enemy is one you know well,[N]
for he deceived all of us,[N]
used all of us![AN]
He has already slain so many innocents,[N]
and now seeks to kill us all,[N]
just to he can gain more power![AN]
Even now, he is amassing more[N]
soldiers from the bodies of those[N]
whose lives he has taken.[AN]
I know you are all exhausted from[N]
fighting one god,[N]
and confused as to this betrayal.[AN]
I am[Beat]shaken as well.[AN]
But we cannot waver,[N]
and strength is with us.[N]
Do you hear the bells, everyone?[AN]
Byelen's power will no longer[N]
be used to control us, and has[N]
now become a song that unites us all![AN]
For our hopes of a free Orodreth,[N]
for everyone who perished to[N]
get us this far, we shall prevail![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Not bad.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Thanks.[A]

## CherneHasRegrets
[MidRight][LoadCherne]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
So they choose to face death,[N]
blade in hand, rather than wait[N]
for my inevitable approach.[AN]
I expected nothing less.[N]
Very well, then. [AN]
I shall grant them the[N]
glorious ends they deserve.[N]
It is[Beat]the least I can do.[AN]
Now, let me use my greatest[N]

strike truer than Eitha's bolts![A][X]

## CleoTellsYouToCheckInventory

How[Beat]vexing. To have come so far,[N]
suffered so much,[N]
only to fail at the very end.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]

[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What are you waiting for?[AN]
You said you would carve your own[N]
path, make your own choices,[N]
and fight destiny, no?[AN]
Surely that wasn't[N]
simply a childish outburst?[AN]
I'm standing in your way,[N]
so you ought to end me.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]You're still trying to tell[N]
me what to do, even now?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I suppose I am. So what?[N]
Will you permit me to live,[N]
just out of spite?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]

Truly over, this time.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I hope so.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Loewe, about Cherne[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
He was deceitful. He lied and[N]
hid the truth so many times,[N]
and we discovered it over and over.[AN]
It'd have been foolish to have still[N]
trusted him, even before he[N]
revealed himself as Cherne.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, you don't need to pretend.[AN]
I didn't trust him, and I'm still[N]
appalled at what kind of monster[N]
he turned out to be.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'm not pretending.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]We promised no more lying,[N]
between us.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Okay, fine. It hurts. A lot, even. [N]
But right now[Beat][AN]
I really don't want to talk about it. [AN]
I just want to go to bed.[N]
Maybe sleep for a week or two.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Fair enough. [N]
I'm about ready to collapse too.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Seriously[Beat]did we really just kill[N]
two different gods on the same day?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]I suppose that's probably a record, heh.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Pfftahahaha. Yeah. Yeah[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Everyone's already begun celebrating.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Good. We've lost so much[Beat][AN]
but if we gave up hope for[N]
a better future too,[N]
then all of this was pointless.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]There's still so much work to be done.[AN]
Cythes may keep its blessing,[N]
but the rot of our values needs[N]
to be ripped out.[AN]
Everywhere else still needs to rebuild too.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And we'll do it. One day at a time.[N]
It won't be easy.[AN]
I've made a lot of mistakes[Beat][N]
and I'm sure there'll be more[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
But that's just what it[N]
means to make choices.[AN]
There's nothing wrong with[N]
having regrets,[AN]
as long as we learn from them[N]
and work towards the future.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You didn't have to finish it for me.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]If I waited for you to finish your thought,[N]
I'd be waiting all night.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Oh ha ha. But seriously,[N]
maybe it's just my being naive again,[AN]
but I think we'll be alright.[N]
As long as we have each other, right?[AN]
We can do anything.[A]
[MidLeft]
How optimistic.[N]
[Beat]But I agree. We can do this.[A]
[MidRight]
Let's get started, then. [N]
I think everyone's waiting for us.[A][X]
