Hold a moment, Coralia.[N]
We can leave the palace when[N]
those guards clear the area.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, we've carefully evaded their[N]
patrols so far, but being caught[N]
here could cause[Beat] complications.[AN]
Still, we should eavesdrop on these[N]
soldiers before we depart, Elias.[N]
They may know something we do not[Beat][A][X]

// two soldiers move through the courtyard before stopping and chatting

## Ch23InThePalace2
[MidLeft][Load23GreenSoldier]
[MidRight][Load23RedSoldier][ThreeLineBox]
Man, are we the only two making[N]
the rounds right now? I've never[N]
seen the palace so deserted.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Shouldn't be surprising, pal.[N]
With all those people coming in,[N]
everyone else is busy guarding them.[AN]
[MidRight]
That so[Beat] Gotta say, it's a bit odd[N]
that civilians from all over Cythes are[N]
flooding into the palace at once.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not just civilians, either. After[N]
Mahemen's rebels retook Wustheim,[N]
Cythean soldiers came here all at once.[AN]
Seems like the top brass think their[N]
best shot is concentrating all our[N]
forces right here in the capital.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wasn't only soldiers with them.[N]
though. There were a few hooded[N]
fellas under a tight guard, right?[AN]
Something big's going on, Ulrich,[N]
and I don't like it one bit.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe so, but that's outside our[N]
pay grade. We just need to keep[N]
doing our job and leave it at that.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Right.[A][X]

// elias and coralia move into the courtyard and get ready to exit

## Ch23InThePalace3
[MidLeft][LoadElias]
[MidRight][LoadCoralia]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] So that's why no one's around[N]
the capital. My dad always said that the[N]
palace held vast catacombs beneath it,[AN]
so the citizens must be hiding there.[AN]
That explains why so many soldiers are[N]
needed here in the capital, at least.[AN]
[MidRight]
Still, something seems odd.[N]
Is ceding so much ground and opting for[N]
a siege worth the costs incurred?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's tough to say, but either way,[N]
things are heating up. Even though it[N]
seems the Liberators won in Chouwouj,[AN]
Kassandra proved a thorn in our side.[N]
I saw her fly into the palace with the[N]
weapons in hand, so we'll have to-[A]
[MidRight]
The weapons[Beat] Wait a moment, Elias.[AN]
The heroes[Beat] Vast amounts of people[Beat][N]
Why does this feels so familiar?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What's wrong, Coralia?[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
Ah, it seems the girl has caught on.[N]
Your heir is quite clever, eh Orfeas?[A][X]

// Orfeas, Mithras, Kassandra, and Leonidas arrive, catching the two off guard

[FarRight][LoadCoralia]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Grandfather, and[Beat] who are you?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We can discuss that later.[N]
I'm sure your grandfather would[N]
like to speak to you first, girl.[A]
[FarLeft]
Coralia[Beat] I cannot begin to[N]
express my joy at your return.[N]
Elias, I thank you for protecting her.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I-It was my duty, sir. Nothing more.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Even so, you did it well. [N]
That you two survived and escaped[N]
enemy territory in Mahemen[Beat][AN]
It is a scarce source of good news.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][Left][ClearFace]
[Left][LoadLeonidas]
I too am glad. However[Beat] I have[N]
heard news that Cleo still lives,[N]
and that she numbers among the rebels.[AN]
Did you know about this, Elias?[AN]
[Right]
I did. I wanted to try and convince[N]
her to come back before telling you,[N]
but she's made up her mind, it seems.[AN]
She must get that focus from Mother.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps. Still, your arrival means[N]
we have a traitor in our midst. Well,[AN]
Kassandra? Have you anything to say[N]
after slandering the two of them?[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadKassandra][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I see no evidence that I've lied,[N]
Sir Leonidas, not when these two[N]
scurry about the palace like rats.[AN]
These aren't the actions of people[N]
serving Cythes, are they?[N]
I say we should imprison them, quickly.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
You[Beat]![A]
[Right]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadOrfeas]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Left][LoadMystery][ThreeLineBox]
Now, now, Sir Leonidas. As unlikely as[N]
it may be, I'm afraid the knight has[N]
a point. If they were our allies,[AN]
would they not come through the front?[N]
What is your defense, Lady Coralia?[A]
[FarRight]
I[Beat] Kassandra attacked us both[N]
in Mahemen, Grandfather. Elias[N]
is the only reason I survived.[AN]
I feared that if we made our way[N]
in through normal means, she may[N]
make another attempt on my life.[AN]
[FarLeft]
A fair assumption. To tell the truth,[N]
I've long suspected foul play on her[N]
part. Guards, seize Dame Kassandra![AN]
[Left]
No, that won't be necessary, Orfeas.[N]
Your granddaughter speaks true, but[N]
part of her story has been left out.[AN]
Our Lorekeeper brethren reported[N]
sightings of her and Sir Elias[N]
in Decia, mingling with the Liberators.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Wait, you're one of them?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Do not interrupt me, foolish knight.[N]
[Beat]As I was saying, it's best that[N]
we have them jailed for the time being,[AN]
until we can determine the truth.[N]
I trust you won't object, Orfeas?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Is there no other way, my lord?[A]
[Left]
You know the answer to that.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Very well. I'm sorry, Coralia, Elias.[A][X]

// Soldiers move towards Elias and Coralia, surrounding them

[MidRight][LoadCoralia]
[OpenQuote]My lord?" You couldn't be[Beat][N]
Are you Byelen's avatar?[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh? You know that much? Perhaps you're[N]
more interesting than I expected,[N]
noble pup. Yes, I am Byelen![AN]
Though, I suppose you could have[N]
called the man in control of this[N]
body "Mithras," not too long ago.[AN]
He was[Beat] well, I struggle to keep[N]
track of all the "Byelens" that have[N]
come after me, to tell you the truth.[AN]
In any case, he no longer holds any[N]
sway over this body. For many, many[N]
years, I've tried to regain control,[AN]
but none of my avatars were weak[N]
enough for me to accomplish that.[AN]
None, until foolish Mithras refused[N]
to continue the cycle in the vain[N]
hopes of severing it entirely![AN]
He held out for many years,[N]
but at last, I am in control,[N]
both of his body and Orodreth's future.[A][X]

## Ch23InThePalace6
[MidLeft][LoadMystery]
[Right][LoadElias]
[FarRight][LoadCoralia]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
So you've finally come out of hiding?[N]
Riddle me this, then. Why are you[N]
gathering people in the capital?[AN]
[MidLeft]
You haven't already realized? Not the[N]
sharpest axe in the rack, are you?[N]
What is your guess, Lady Coralia?[AN]
[FarRight]
I[Beat] You have all four weapons now,[N]
correct? If you have those and[N]
thousands of people at your disposal[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
It seems you have an idea, so allow[N]
me to fill you in. I mean to reverse the[N]
Rite of Eternity and revive the heroes.[AN]
They will be the immortals they always[N]
should have been[Beat] under my control,[N]
unlike when they nearly overpowered me.[AN]
[Right]
Wait[Beat] You can't mean that you're[N]
Abalone IX? The last emperor of the[N]
old empire before the heroes felled it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That I am. The blessing of[N]
Byelen I spoke of was no delusion.[AN]
Even so, the heroes were powerful enough[N]
to bring me to my knees! Defeated as I[N]
was, I couldn't control the cycle,[AN]
so thanks to them, my future avatars had[N]
their own will. At least, until now.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Humor me, Byelen. What is your[N]
intent in resurrecting the heroes?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, before you two came waltzing in,[N]
I thought they would aid me in the fight[N]
against the wielder of the Kaiserschwert.[AN]
But now that the girl is here, I can use[N]
them and the defective Seed before me[N]
in order to restore my divinity.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm the Seed? Like Loewe?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Not quite. He's a false one, but he at[N]
least has all the necessary properties.[AN]
Still, despite being defective, you've[N]
saved me a great deal of trouble. Know[N]
that you have my eternal gratitude, girl.[A][X]

## Ch23InThePalace7
[FarLeft][LoadOrfeas]
[Left][LoadMystery]
[Right][LoadElias]
[FarRight][LoadCoralia]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Please wait, Lord Byelen! This was not[N]
our deal. You said that Coralia's life[N]
could be spared, did you not?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you questioning this[N]
decision, my descendant?[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I am not, but-[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We cannot allow a chance like this to[N]
pass us by. With just one girl's[N]
sacrifice, and a few thousand more,[AN]
I will regain my power and my place.[AN]
Orodreth will once again have a true[N]
god watching over it, protecting it.[AN]
Cythes will thrive, not die out,[N]
and Orodreth will never know strife.[AN]
Is saving so many not worth the few?[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox][ToggleMouthMove]
(They're distracted, Coralia.[N]
We have to find a way out, now!)[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
(But how? They have us surrounded[N]
on all sides. If we only had a small[N]
opening, we could escape, but[Beat][.4])[A][X]

[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No[Beat] Mithras?! You weren't[N]
supposed to be alive, and yet,[N]
you intend to stop me now?![AN]
[FarRight]
That[Beat] must be the real form[N]
of Byelen? How pathetic[Beat][A]
[Left]
Quite right. I've lingered in his[N]
subconscious for quite some time,[N]
only resurfacing at key moments[Beat][AN]
Take advantage of their indecision,[AN]
little sprout, and flee now.[AN]
The guards should prove wanting[N]
against your crimson knight.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Wha- Who are you?[N]
How are you in my head?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Now is not the time for questions,[N]
young Seed. You must run, quickly,[N]
while I still can hold him back![A]
[Right]
Ah, then you are[Beat] Thank you,[N]
Mithras! I won't forget this![A]
[FarLeft]
You[Beat] miserable cur! I am a god,
and you would treat me like this?
Submit to my will, Mithras!
[Left]
A god? Please. You're nothing more than[N]
a gnarled stump whose roots greedily[N]
grasp at all of Orodreth, Byelen.[AN]
You will defeat me, I have no doubt,[N]
but not before these two escape your[N]
twisted grip. Run, seedlings![A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Right. Clear the way, Elias![A][X]

[Left][LoadMithras]
[FarLeft]
See? SEE? It's exactly as I said![N]
Both of them are traitors to Cythes.[AN]
Lord Byelen, what happened?[N]
Why did you not strike them down?[AN]

Ohhh, Mithras[Beat] You will regret[N]
your meaningless resistance, worm![AN]

[MidRight][LoadOrfeas]
[MidLeft]
It seems a piece of Mithras lingered,
but no more. I am once again in control.
[Right]
[Beat]My lord, what of my granddaughter?
[MidLeft]
Bah! If you care for her, then make the
ritual happen faster. Without Coralia
in reach, the false Seed must do.
Kassandra will no doubt fail, but she
will buy us time to revive the heroes.
[Right]
I will do as you bid, Lord Byelen.[A][X]

// Orfeas leaves, descending into the basement

## Ch23InThePalace11
[MidLeft][LoadMithras]
[MidRight][LoadLeonidas][OneLineBox]
[Beat]And what of my role?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You and whatever leftovers we have can[N]
sit here and buy time. I don't expect[N]
much, but do all that you can.[AN]
Who knows? I may even spare your[N]
children if you do well enough,[N]
despite their folly in facing me.[A][X]

// Mithras leaves, following Orfeas

## Ch23InThePalace12
[MidRight][LoadLeonidas][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Orfeas, is this truly what you[N]
desire? A life kneeling at the feet[N]
of a ruler who only prizes power,[AN]
for its own sake and nothing more?[AN]
It is the role of the Argymos to serve[N]
the imperial line, but if my service[N]
results in sacrifice, then I[Beat][.4][A][X]

// ## Ch23TheLiberatorsArrive1


// SCENE 2: The Liberators arrive at Gechrysos through the back entrance. Loewe complains about the march through Mount Sarloos, saying how rough it was, but Cleo chides him and tells him to focus on the task ahead. The back way into Gechrysos is lightly guarded, as the majority of their forces are concentrated towards the southwest in order to keep away the Mahemeni forces, led by the Sacred Arrow Rebels. Kwame mentions that they've served as an excellent distraction for them, and that they should help Boro and Barod arrive with relative ease. Just as they make ready to charge, Elias and Coralia run into the center of the town, closely pursued by Kassandra and other knights. When they're surrounded, Kassandra stops, wanting to relish in their panic. The Liberators, noticing this, begin their assault immediately, making ready to charge on the town. MAP START
