Hold a moment, Coralia.[N]
We can leave the palace when[N]
those guards clear the area.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, we've carefully evaded their[N]
patrols so far, but being caught[N]
here could cause[Beat] complications.[AN]
Still, we should eavesdrop on these[N]
soldiers before we depart, Elias.[N]
They may know something we do not[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][Load23RedSoldier][ThreeLineBox]
Man, are we the only two making[N]
the rounds right now? I've never[N]
seen the palace so deserted.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Shouldn't be surprising, pal.[N]
With all those people coming in,[N]
everyone else is busy guarding them.[AN]
[MidRight]
That so[Beat] Gotta say, it's a bit odd[N]
that civilians from all over Cythes are[N]
flooding into the palace at once.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not just civilians, either. After[N]
Mahemen's rebels retook Wustheim,[N]
Cythean soldiers came here all at once.[AN]
Seems like the top brass think their[N]
best shot is concentrating all our[N]
forces right here in the capital.[AN]
[MidRight]
They must know something we don't[Beat][N]
Something big's going on, Ulrich,[N]
and I don't like it one bit.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe so, but that's outside our[N]
pay grade. We just need to keep[N]
doing our job and leave it at that.[AN]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] So that's why no one's around[N]
the capital. My dad always said that the[N]
palace held vast catacombs beneath it,[AN]
so the citizens must be hiding there.[AN]
That explains why so many soldiers are[N]
needed here in the capital, at least.[AN]
[MidRight]
Still, something seems odd.[N]
Is ceding so much ground and opting for[N]
a siege worth the costs incurred?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It's tough to say, but either way,[N]
things are heating up. Even though it[N]
seems the Liberators won in Chouwouj,[AN]
Kassandra proved a thorn in our side.[N]
I saw her fly into the palace with the[N]
weapons in hand, so we'll have to-[A]
[MidRight]
The weapons[Beat] Wait a moment, Elias.[AN]
The heroes[Beat] Vast amounts of people[Beat][N]
Why does this feel so familiar?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm? What's wrong, Coralia?[AN]
[FarFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah, it seems the girl has caught on.[N]

Grandfather, and[Beat] who are you?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We can discuss that later.[N]
I'm sure your grandfather would[N]
like to speak to you first, girl.[A]
[FarRight]
Coralia[Beat] I cannot begin to[N]
express my joy at your return.[N]
Elias, I thank you for protecting her.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
I-It was my duty, sir. Nothing more.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Even so, you did it well. [N]
That you two survived and escaped[N]
enemy territory in Mahemen[Beat][AN]
We desperately needed good news.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadLeonidas]
I too am glad. However[Beat] I have[N]
heard news that Cleo still lives,[N]
and that she numbers among the rebels.[AN]
Did you know about this, Elias?[AN]
[Left]
I did. I wanted to try and convince[N]
her to come back before telling you,[N]
but she's made up her mind, it seems.[AN]
She must get that focus from Mother.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps. Still, your arrival means[N]
we have a traitor in our midst. Well,[AN]
Kassandra? Have you anything to say[N]
after slandering the two of them?[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadKassandra][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I see no evidence that I've lied,[N]
Sir Leonidas, not when these two[N]
scurry about the palace like rats.[AN]
These aren't the actions of people[N]
serving Cythes, are they?[N]
I say we should imprison them, quickly.[AN]

Now, now, Sir Leonidas. As unlikely as[N]
it may be, I'm afraid the knight has[N]
a point. If they were our allies,[AN]
would they not come through the front?[N]
What is your defense, Lady Coralia?[A]
[FarLeft]
I[Beat] Kassandra attacked us both[N]
in Mahemen, Grandfather. Elias[N]
is the only reason I survived.[AN]
I feared that if we made our way[N]
in through normal means, she may[N]
make another attempt on my life.[AN]
[FarRight]
A fair assumption. To tell the truth,[N]
I've long suspected foul play on her[N]
part. Guards, seize Dame Kassandra![AN]
[Right]
No, that won't be necessary, Orfeas.[N]
Your granddaughter speaks true, but[N]
part of her story has been left out.[AN]
Our Lorekeeper brethren reported[N]
sightings of her and Sir Elias[N]
in Decia, mingling with the Liberators.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Wait, you're one of them?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Do not interrupt me, foolish knight.[N]
[Beat]As I was saying, it's best that[N]
we have them jailed for the time being,[AN]
until we can determine the truth.[N]
I trust you won't object, Orfeas?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Is there no other way, my lord?[A]
[Right]
You know the answer to that.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Very well. I'm sorry, Coralia, Elias.[A][X]

[OpenQuote]My lord?" You couldn't be[Beat][N]
Are you Byelen's avatar?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Oh? You know that much? Perhaps you're[N]
more interesting than I expected,[N]
noble pup. Yes, I am Byelen![AN][.7][.7]
Though, I suppose you could have[N]
called the man in control of this[N]
body "Mithras," not too long ago.[AN]
He was[Beat] well, he no longer holds[N]
sway over this body. For many, many[N]
years, I've tried to regain control,[AN]
but all of my avatars stood strong.[AN]
That is, until Mithras chose not to[N]
claim a Seed and aimed to end the cycle.[N]
A fool to the end[Beat] One I must thank.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
So you've finally come out of hiding?[N]
You saved us some trouble looking, then.[N]
Why are you amassing people in Gechrysos?[AN]
[Right]
You haven't already realized? Not the[N]
sharpest axe in the rack, are you?[N]
What is your guess, Lady Coralia?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I[Beat] You have all four weapons now,[N]
correct? If you have those and[N]
thousands of people at your disposal[Beat][AN]
[Right]
It seems you have an idea, so allow[N]
me to fill you in. I aim to reverse the[N]
Rite of Eternity and revive the heroes.[AN]
They will be the immortals they always[N]
should have been[Beat] under my control,[N]
unlike when they nearly overpowered me.[AN]
[Left]
Wait[Beat] Overpowered you? The last[N]
person who could claim that is Abalone IX,[N]
the last emperor of the old empire.[AN]
[Right]
Indeed, I am He. The blessing of[N]
Byelen I spoke of was no delusion.[AN]
Even so, the heroes were powerful enough[N]
to bring me to my knees! Defeated as I[N]
was, I couldn't control the cycle,[AN]
so thanks to them, my future avatars had[N]
their own will. At least, until now.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Humor me, Byelen. What is your[N]
intent in resurrecting the heroes?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well, before you two came waltzing in,[N]
I thought they would aid me in the fight[N]
against the wielder of the Kaiserschwert.[AN]
But now that the girl is here, I can use[N]
them and the defective Seed before me[N]
in order to restore my divinity.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm the Seed? Like Loewe?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Not quite. He's a false one, but he at[N]
least has all the necessary properties.[AN]
Still, despite your shortcomings, you've[N]
saved me a great deal of trouble. Know[N]
that you have my eternal gratitude, girl.[A]
[FarRight][LoadOrfeas]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Please wait, Lord Byelen! This was not[N]
our deal. You said that Coralia's life[N]
could be spared, did you not?[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you questioning this[N]
decision, my descendant?[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I am not, but-[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We cannot allow a chance like this to[N]
pass us by. With just one girl's[N]
sacrifice, and a few thousand more,[AN]
I will regain my power and my place.[AN]
Orodreth will once again have a true[N]
god watching over it, protecting it.[AN]
Cythes will thrive, not die out,[N]
and Orodreth will never know strife.[AN]
Is saving so many not worth the few?[AN]

No[Beat] Mithras?! You weren't[N]

you intend to stop me now?![AN]

You should have checked more thoroughly,[N]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm conscious, but[Beat] I can't move,[N]
and their voices are echoing in my head,[N]
[Beat]Is this some kind of telepathy?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Indeed. Byelen possesses that ability,[N]
which I'm using for my own purposes.[A]
[FarRight]
Byelen being that[Beat] thing?[N]
I expected a bit more, honestly.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Now isn't the time to stare, seedlings.[N]
Take advantage of the emperor's doubt[N]

Are you the real Mithras?[N]
How are you in my head?[AN]

We have no time for your questions,[N]

You[Beat] miserable cur! I am a god,[N]
and you would treat me like this?[AN]
Submit to my will, Mithras![AN]

A god? Please. You're nothing more than[N]
a gnarled stump whose roots greedily[N]
grasp at all of Orodreth, Byelen.[AN]
I may not be the one to defeat you,[N]

Bah! If you care for her, then make the[N]

near, the false Seed works just as well.[AN]
Kassandra will likely fail us, but she[N]
can buy us time to revive the heroes[N]

which is[Beat] unsurprising for him.[N]
We should make to meet up with him.[AN]

All we have to do is make our[N]
