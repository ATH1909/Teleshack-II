That so[Beat] Gotta say, it's a bit odd[N]
that civilians from all over Cythes are[N]
flooding into the palace at once.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not just civilians, either. After[N]
Mahemen's rebels retook Wustheim,[N]
Cythean soldiers came here all at once.[AN]
Seems like the top brass think their[N]
best shot is concentrating all our[N]

Something big's going on, Ulrich,[N]

Hm[Beat] So that's why no one's around[N]

That explains why so many soldiers are[N]
needed here in the capital, at least.[AN]

Still, something seems odd.[N]
Is ceding so much ground and opting for[N]
a siege worth the costs incurred?[AN]

It's tough to say, but either way,[N]
things are heating up. Even though it[N]

I too am glad. However[Beat] I have[N]

Did you know about this, Elias?[AN]

What is your defense, Lady Coralia?[A]
[FarLeft]
I[Beat] Kassandra attacked us both[N]
in Mahemen, Grandfather. Elias[N]
is the only reason I survived.[AN]
I feared that if we made our way[N]
in through normal means, she may[N]
make another attempt on my life.[AN]
[FarRight]
A fair assumption. To tell the truth,[N]
I've long suspected foul play on her[N]
part. Guards, seize Dame Kassandra![AN]
[Right]
No, that won't be necessary, Orfeas.[N]
Your granddaughter speaks true, but[N]
part of her story has been left out.[AN]

Though, I suppose you could have[N]
called the man in control of this[N]
body "Mithras," not too long ago.[AN]
He was[Beat] well, he no longer holds[N]
sway over this body. For many, many[N]
years, I've tried to regain control,[AN]

That is, until Mithras chose not to[N]
claim a Seed and aimed to end the cycle.[N]

You saved us some trouble looking, then.[N]

They will be the immortals they always[N]
should have been[Beat] under my control,[N]
unlike when they nearly overpowered me.[AN]
[Left]
Wait[Beat] Overpowered you? The last[N]
person who could claim that is Abalone IX,[N]
the last emperor of the old empire.[AN]
[Right]
Indeed, I am He. The blessing of[N]
Byelen I spoke of was no delusion.[AN]
Even so, the heroes were powerful enough[N]
to bring me to my knees! Defeated as I[N]
was, I couldn't control the cycle,[AN]
so thanks to them, my future avatars had[N]
their own will. At least, until now.[AN]

Well, before you two came waltzing in,[N]

But now that the girl is here, I can use[N]

in order to restore my divinity.[AN]

Prepare yourself, Liberators![N]
Face one truly blessed by Byelen, me![A][X]

// ending scene outline:
// 1) quick blurb about how the section of the town they're in is secured; the Liberators line up the enemy generals and their troops, if they captured them
// need Tiberius or Iskra alive and in the party to recruit Viktor, and need Cromar alive to recruit Maryn
// VIKTOR:
// gives Tiberius the Boltblade (1-2, high Mt magic sword)
// gives Iskra the Iskalibur (1-2 range, high crit tome)
// MARYN:
// gives Cromar the Dawn Pendant (post battle, sets fog to 0)
// 3) After speaking to all captured characters, Loewe and Kwame survey the area in order to prep for the final push; Barod and Boro show up, saying they managed to sneak through the southern blockade due to Mahemen's offensive distracting Cythes's soldiers; With this, Kwame presses Loewe to consider his options re: the ritual, and Loewe comes to his decision (but doesn't say it on screen); Meanwhile, Cleo and Elias are scouting off screen
// 4) Cleo and Elias head to the pass to scout it out and runs into Leonidas; he duels Cleo and finds her wanting. They have an argument about philosophy, the strong versus the weak, Leonidas mentions why he was so harsh on her in his early years of fatherhood (wanted her to become strong), and ultimately decides that no one possesses the strength to overcome Byelen's power, which is why he's siding with Byelen. Cleo calls him a coward for this, but Leonidas only responds to tell her that if she believes otherwise, then she can prove it to him in the palace

//after the battle, Loewe, Cleo, Elias, and Coralia gather in the main square. They talk about Kassandra's death, Elias and Coralia thank them for saving them, and Coralia tells the pair that after the battle, she feels exhausted and needs to rest. She leaves, going into a nearby house. Loewe, Cleo, and Elias then go to the captured leaders that Kwame has rounded up, and each one speaks to one individually (Loewe to Saif and Maryn, Cleo to Mihail and Viktor, and Elias to Artemis) and then, Tiberius + Iskra speak to Viktor if alive and Cromar to Maryn and get goodies for this
//after the round up, the group decides to recover shortly while Cleo and Elias do reconnaissance in the pass to make sure the path to the palace is clear. Loewe and Kwame briefly discuss Loewe's choice wrt to the ritual, which he begins to say but then is cut off by the arrival of Barod and Boro. They explain that they made it through due to a Mahemeni force that is at Gechrysos's gates, led by Houvaina and Kailani of the Sacred Arrow Rebels. Kwame wonders if the truth of what happened in Mahemen reached them, but Loewe responds that either way, they now only need to regain the weapons to perform the ritual, which Byelen surely has. The group agrees, deciding to play cards until Cleo and Elias return. Coralia returns to join in on the game, and there is a mirthful, yet uncertain atmosphere.
// Meanwhile, Cleo and Elias fly through the pass, seeing no one and leaving to report this to the Liberators. However, they come across Leonidas, who tells the two that he has come to speak with them, to see if they will change their minds. If they side with Byelen now, they can be spared from the coming onslaught; neither of them agree to this though. Leonidas and Cleo argue about philosophy; Leonidas describes the duty of the Argymos clan to the emperor, thousands upon thousands of years of service, that they are willingly throwing away for their whims that will doom Cythes to return to the wasteland it once was. Cleo disagrees, saying that loyalty simply for the sake of it means nothing at all. Further, if they do perform the Rite of Ascension, then a new Byelen can arise, and one who doesn't need the support of the empire. Leonidas simply shakes his head and curses his failures in instilling them both with enough loyalty to the throne; Cleo says that it is due to his words, that the strong must use their power to protect the weak, that she chose this path. Leonidas sighs, telling them one last time that if they continue on this path, he cannot hold anything back. The siblings swear to fight to the end, and he leaves. Elias tells her that he'll leave command of the final battle to her, seeing as she's surpassed him. They then start flying back, and Cleo says that all that's left now is Loewe's choice... and that if he makes the wrong one, all of Cythes will pay the price.

And what would that be?[AN]

I'm sure you've noticed how barren the[N]

All at the behest of Byelen himself.[A]

we have to get to the palace immediately![AN]
[Left]
I agree, Loewe, but if we rush in there[N]
like fools, then we'll give the emperor[N]
what he wants. We must exercise caution.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Agreed, and first, we should sort out[N]
any loose ends before leaving the area.[AN]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, you two are the Cytheans. I'm[N]
flying blind around here without you.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]We should scout the pass leading[N]
into the palace, then. This side of[N]
Gechrysos is generally low on manpower,[AN]
but it always pays to be thorough.[AN]

Right. Me and Cleo should be enough for[N]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Wha-[.4] Boro?! When'd you get here?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, you lot took weeks taking the[N]
detour to make your way in. That gave[N]
me plenty of time to make my way here.[AN]
[Beat]Turns out politics is almost as[N]
complicated as fighting a millenia[N]
old god, at least in my books.[AN]
Constant arguing between warlords,[N]

Well, I stuck around long enough.[AN]
Chouwouj won't burn at least,[N]
not until after we bring Byelen down.[AN]
Besides[Beat] I wouldn't want Dragana[N]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]As good a reason as any to come back.[N]
I see you brought Barod with you, too.[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
More the other way around, really.[N]
Boro can handle himself, but I took down[N]
way more soldiers on the way here![AN]
[FarRight]
It's not a competition[Beat] And if it was,[N]
I won! Mahemen's rebels beat the both of[N]
us, though, the way they're fighting.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
The Sacred Arrow Rebels[Beat][N]
They're nearby, then?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, they're causing a huge stir by the[N]
southern gates. Wouldn't be surprised[N]
if they break through, sooner or later.[AN]
[FarRight]
I ran into one of 'em. Kailani, right?[N]
Anyway, she said we should press on[N]
and that they'd catch up if they could.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then[Beat] They're on our side?[N]
Even after the Mureib business?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I don't know about that, but they[N]
know something big's going down,[N]
and that Cythes is our common enemy.[AN]
Can't say what they wanna do after,[N]
but we may as well go along with it.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Either way, I'm glad you both[N]
made it here. We're nearly at the palace.[A]

I'll accompany you all for now, but[N]
I'll hold off from fighting just yet.[N]
Gotta save all my strength for Byelen![A]

enough. I'll follow your lead, Loewe.[AN]

Uh, Kwame? You alright there?[N]
You're not usually so[Beat] forthright.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Think of their reputations, Loewe,[N]
and realize they earned every ounce[N]
of it. Facing one is difficult enough.[AN]
Four? Let's say our chances are slim,[N]
at best, to overcome that nightmare.[N]
They toppled an empire on their own![A][Event]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Who's to say we can't do the same?[N]
We're on Byelen's doorstep, right here,[N]
right now, ready to put him in the dirt.[AN]
But if we don't fight here, we can't win.[N]
We have to stand up and show them how we[N]
got this far[Beat] I have to show them.[AN]
I have to show them that it doesn't matter[N]
why I was born, or whether or not I'm the[N]
Seed. Either way, I'd still be right here.[AN]
A few legendary heroes aren't gonna stop[N]
me from doing what I was always meant to.[N]
Cythes's tyranny will end by our hands![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Heh. Well said, Loewe. Your[N]
unyielding spirit is almost infectious.[N]
Still, there is[Beat] another matter.[AN]
Have you decided what you plan[N]
to do regarding the ritual?[N]
We can't wait any longer on this.[AN]
Whether you choose to slay Byelen,[N]
or replace Him, we must decide now.[AN]
When our force arrives in the palace,[N]
our mission can hold no uncertainty,[N]
lest we all fall to Byelen's forces.[AN]
It's time to make your choice. Which way[N]
tip the scales of your conviction, Loewe?[A]

[Beat]I never thought we'd fight on opposite[N]

your loyalty seemed a cut above.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Neither did I, but that was a long[N]
time ago. You took on an easy post[N]
in the heart of Cythes while I[Beat][AN]
I saw firsthand the horrors of conquest[N]
and came to understand Cythes's sin.[N]
Perhaps you would have too, Mihail.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If I had made a different choice[Beat][N]
Yes, perhaps. Regardless, we stand[N]
opposed. What do you plan to do to me?[AN]
[MidRight]
We don't have the manpower to hold[N]
hostages, and besides, doing that to[N]
you would leave a bad taste in my mouth.[AN]
Swear never to oppose us again,[N]
and I'll let you walk away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Just my word? Isn't that a bit[N]
naive, Cleo? I could lie to you and[N]
come back with the rest of the guard.[AN]
[MidRight]
But you won't. I think you can see that[N]
we mean no harm to ordinary Cytheans.[AN]
Our opponents lie within the palace,[N]
so you should turn your gaze to the[N]
southern gates where Mahemen awaits.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Right as always. Fine, I agree to[N]
your terms. And if you truly mean[N]
what you say, take this as well.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
An axe? This is[Beat] quite heavy.[N]
Are you sure it'll be of use?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's enchanted with powerful magic,[N]
making it perfect for ignoring armor.[N]
I expect you'll find it useful.[A]
[MidRight]
Then thank you, Mihail. I didn't[N]
expect you to aid us, but[Beat][N]
I'm glad that you are, old friend.[AN]

[Beat]You were the last person[N]
I expected to see turn on Cythes,[N]
Elias. Did I not train you right?[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe so, but I appreciate everything[N]
you taught me, Lady Artemis. Still,[N]
why are you here? I thought you retired.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, it wasn't entirely my own choice.[N]
The emperor must be quite desperate if[N]
he has to forcibly enlist an old woman.[AN]
[MidRight]
You're selling yourself short, given[N]
you still run circles around some of[N]
the knights left in the order.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! Well, I wanted to sign up to fight[N]
off the Mahemeni offensive anyway, but[N]
then, Kassandra deployed me here,[AN]
along with a few drafted civilians.[AN]
It's only thanks to the goodwill of[N]
those Liberators that they, and I,[N]
lived through this battle.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, I'm glad you all made it. What's[N]
your plan now with Kassandra's defeat?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] I think I've seen enough here.[N]
If you'll let me go, I'll gather any[N]
noncombatants and escort them north.[AN]
Mount Sarloos may be frigid, but it[N]
beats dying at the hands of enemy[N]
soldiers. You may spare us, but[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You think Mahemen will sack the city?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
They'd have every right to, after all[N]
we've put them through. I've furthered[N]
the emperor's plans too much to complain.[AN]
[Beat]That being said, I have no desire to[N]
see him accomplish them now. Take this.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]An anklet? What does it do?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It grants the user physical and magical[N]
power, at a price. I wore it often in[N]
my youth, but I have no use for it now.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see[Beat] I'll put it to good use, Lady[N]
Artemis. And, when this is all over,[N]
I'll make sure Cythes still stands.[AN]
That's my final oath as a knight.[AN]

Yeah, well[Beat] It's a memento from the[N]

Too important to be used against y'all.[AN]

Fair enough[Beat] If that's all, then[N]
you're free to go, so long as you[N]
don't plan to attack us again.[AN]

Hold up! I talked with the rest of the[N]
guys, and they all wanted you to have[N]
the sword, as thanks for sparing us.[AN]

[Beat]It's important[N]
to you, isn't it?[AN]

It is, but a sword exists to be swung.[N]
Better in your hands taking down[N]
Cythes than wasting away in its sheath.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]

Best of luck, Saif. Live a long life.[AN]
