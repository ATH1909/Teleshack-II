Castle Selese[Beat] it seems[N]
we've made it here safely.[A][N]
From here, once I[N]
recover my strength,[A][N]
we shall regroup and[N]
move in to retake-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Not [OpenQuote]we". You will.[A]
[MidRight]
Wha[Beat]?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The Empire[Beat] cannot continue[N]
to assist you here in Decia.[A][N]
You know what stands to be[N]
lost should you fail to quash[N]
the Liberators here, Cidor.[A][N]
They will come for your head.[A][N]
I hope your preparations go well.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
W-What?!?[A][N]
You're just going to leave[N]
me to handle this on my own?[A][N]
Whose side are you[N]
on anyway, Elias?[A][N]
We both know you could have[N]
slaughtered the rebels without me![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
And if I had pursued the
Liberators over you at Freyse,[N]
who would remain to rule Decia?[A][N]
This fair country has suffered[N]
far enough already. If its[N]
ruler were to fall, too[Beat][A][N]
then Decia would burn to[N]
ash, and all of Cythes'[N]
sins would be in vain.[A][N]
[Beat]I am sorry.[A][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
W-Wait! Blast you![A][N]
You traitorous cur![N]
You hypocritical dastard![A][N]
Do you mean to see my home[N]
through to a bloody end?![A][N]
Get[Beat] back here![A][N]
[CloseEyes]Hrrggh[Beat]![A]
[MidLeft][LoadSoldier]
L-Lord Cidor! You're wounded![N]
Someone, fetch a healer![A]

## Ch11Start_News
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I can't believe how far[N]
we've come.[AN]
But still -[N]
So many obstacles remain.[AN]
Mother[Beat] Father[Beat] Dragana[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Count the flickers of the[N]
candle's flame Cidor.[AN]
Your time has come to an end.[A] 
[MidLeft][LoadSeleseF][TwoLineBox]
Commander Loewe, we followed[N]
Elias and Cidor until nightfall.[AN]
They're heading directly[N]
south from here,[A][N]
and flying over the countryside[N]
past the Selese border.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Thank you Onson.[AN]
You risked your life to[N]
bring us this information.[AN]
Go, get some rest.[AN]
We've got a long day[N]
ahead of us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Clear][Beat]Elias must have[N]
let her follow.[AN]
His wyvern could easily escape[N]
my own's pursuit if he tried,[AN]
Even while carrying[N]
the added deadweight.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loewe! Have you been up here[N]
this entire time?[AN]
Surely you can't spend all evening[N]
brooding like this.[AN]
Dragana wanted us to run this[N]
rebellion together.[AN]
Not have one of us off sulking[N]
like a child.[A] 
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The scout I sent returned.[N]
Reportedly Cidor and Elias[AN]
are headed directly south.[AN]
We should set out as soon as[N]
possible.[AN]
Before they can make[N]
preparations for our arrival.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We can't even be sure where exactly[N]
they were heading.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeineBox]
Castle Selese is a safe bet.[AN]
It's Cidor's seat of power,[N]
so he'd likely flee there[N]
when all else is lost.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I must agree with Sir Loewe.[N]
Lady Cleo.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadKwame][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Every moment we spend here[N]
is a moment closer the Cytheans[N]
get to achieving their goals.[AN]
I know of an ancient, forbidden[N]
tunnel through the Tenet Caves.[A][N]
It connects to the dungeons of[N]
a Reclamation Wars guard tower[N]
just outside Castle Selese.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Going through these caves[N]
would be a risky gambit,[A][N]
but we could evade Cidor's[N]
soldiers in the countryside[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
With Radnitz's assistance and[N]
the momentum our cause has gained,[A][N]
the Liberators may now be the[N]
strongest army on Decian soil.[A][N]
If we travel through these caves,[A][N]
we will let no one and nothing[N]
stand between us and Cidor's end[Beat][A][N]
between us and Dragana's vengeance.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well.[A][N]
Kwame, can we trust you to[N]
guide us through these caves?[A]
[FarLeft]
Certainly.[A][N]
I'll need some time to refresh[N]
my memory of them, though[Beat][A][N]
I'll speak with[N]
you again tomorrow.[A][ClearFace]
[Left]
In that case, I will inform Lord[N]
Radnitz and our troops of the plan.[A][ClearFace]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[OpenLeft][LoadCleo]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, I suppose I have no[N]
choice but to wish you both luck.[AN]
Mounted troops will[N]
struggle down in caves,[A][N]
so I'll send some infantry from[N]
my personal guard to join you.[A][N]
Put them to good use.[A]
[Left]
Thank you, Lord Radnitz.[AN]
The next time you see us, it will[N]
be as Decian Liberators victorious.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenFarRight][LoadIchwep]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
So, I heard you folks got a problem[N]
with a Cythean infestation.[AN]
Well guess what, Loewe, Cleo?[N]
It looks like you're in luck![AN]
See, I also have a problem[N]
with a Cythean infestation.[AN]
And a very big axe.[AN]
My name is Milo, and this[N]
here is my daughter, Ichwep-[AN]
[OpenFarRight][OneLineBox]
We're not related.[A]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
That's but a small detail in[X]
the grand scheme of things![A]
[OpenLeft]
It's a pleasure to make your[N]
acquaintance, Lady Ichwep, Sir Milo.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Likewise.[AN]
Radnitz already briefed[N]
you on the plan, right?[A]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Passing through the Tenet Caves?[AN]
That is[Beat] certainly[N]
an interesting decision.[A][N]
Everything I've heard says they're[N]
all collapsed tunnels and dead ends.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Our advisor has assured us that[N]
he knows a path to Castle Selese.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Anyway, we are glad to count new[N]
allies like you two among us.[A]
[Right]
Here's to a free Decia![A]
Once we topple Cidor, I'll take[N]
you to this pub back in Freyse[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
Didn't you get us both banned[N]
from that pub for life?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Small details.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
And that's when I went to the[N]
stablemaster and asked him,[A][N]
[OpenQuote]Hey buddy, why the long face?"[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Wahaha! That's a good one, Milo![A][N]
It's good to see people who[N]
can remain in such high spirits[N]
despite these troubling times.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And these troubling caves.[N]
They're one heck of a maze![A][N]
Why, if I didn't know better,[A][N]
I'd think that Ichwep would've[N]
gotten lost in them already.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed.[A][N]
We've spent so long down here[N]
that I've lost track of how[N]
much time has passed[Beat][A][N]
It must be my old[N]
age getting to me.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A][X]

## Ch11Start_IchwepCaveChat
[MidLeft][LoadIchwep]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Please, Commander Cleo,[A][N]
allow me to lead your pegasus[N]
through these corridors.[A][N]
I'm sure your attention would[N]
be better spent elsewhere.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
My apologies, Ichwep, but he[N]
is quite particular about[N]
who he lets handle hi-[A]
H-hey, don't go licking her![A][N]
[Beat]Very well. I suppose I[N]
should check in with Loewe.[A][X]

## Ch11Start_LordsChat
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft]
Are you and your[N]
force holding up?[A]
[MidRight]
Aye. We're making good progress,[N]
and everyone's in high spirits.[A][N]
Milo especially looks like he's[N]
here for a party, not a war.[A]
[MidLeft]
It is nice to see everyone[N]
smiling for a change.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]We're so close to the end[Beat] to[N]
fulfilling General Dragana's dream.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]Where's Kwame?[AN]
I thought he was out here,[N]
helping you forge a path.[A]
[MidRight]
He told me he went back[N]
to help your rearguard[Beat][A][N]
Kwame was here a minute ago.[N]
He couldn't have gotten too far.[A]
[MidLeft]
We need Kwame if we want to[N]
ever make it out of here.[A][N]
Let's split up and find him.[A][X]

## Ch11Start_KwameAlone // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snKJPEVbQoE
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
Hah[Beat] hah[Beat] I'm not built for[N]
this sort of sprinting anymore.[A][N]
Now that I've gotten out of[N]
their sight, it should be[N]
just around this corner[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]No[Beat] Oh, no.[A] The seal[N]
I placed here, all those years[N]
ago[Beat] it's broken? Who[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][LoadCidor][OneLineBox]
Looking for something, Kwame?[A]
[MidLeft][Jump][TwoLineBox]
D-Duke Cidor![A][N]
If you're down here,[N]
then that means[Beat]![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]That's right. I've[N]
a clue to just who[N]
you truly are, Kwame.[A][N]
I didn't want to[N]
believe it at first,[A][N]
but just seeing your[N]
face now gave it away.[A][N]
It's been decades, and yet[N]
you haven't aged a day[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]So you've figured it out.[N]
What do you want from me, Cidor?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm a dead man, Kwame.[A][N]
Why don't you come, and[N]
walk with me a moment?[A][N]
Walk with me, and tell me why[N]
I sacrificed the dignity of[N]
my friends and countrymen.[A][N]
Tell me the truth of why I let[N]
the empire devour the lives[N]
and livelihoods of Decia.[A][N]
Tell me the truth of why I gave up[N]
my daughter and my true love.[A][N]
Tell[.5] me[.5] the[.5] truth[.5] of[.5] this[.5] world![A][N]
[Beat]Refuse, and I'll take all that[N]
I've found straight to those two.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I see, Cidor.[A][N]
In that case,[N]
I'll tell you[Beat][A][N]
I'll tell you a tale,[N]
from long, long ago[Beat][A][X]

## Ch11Start_BadGuysAreHere
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Beat]It's no use.[N]
Kwame's trail ends here.[A][N]
It's almost as if he[N]
disappeared out of nowhere[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][LoadIchwep]
Lady Cleo, there are footsteps[N]
coming from all sides.[A][N]
Some of them are soldiers wearing[N]
the armor of Selese troops.[A]
[MidLeft]
But Kwame said Duke Cidor didn't[N]
know about these caves[Beat] unless[Beat]?[A][N]
[OpenEyes][Beat]It seems this place[N]
isn't so empty after all.[A][N]
We'll need to break through![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Understood! I'll do you proud.[A][X]

## Ch11_InTheCell

[MidRight][LoadSenny]
Hey, wake up! Those are[N]
the sounds of fighting![A]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Somebody's here to save us[Beat]?[A][X]

## Ch11_OpenSisterDoor
[MidLeft][LoadActive]
[Right][LoadSenny]
[FarRight][LoadSenny]
Who are you? Are[N]
you here to free us?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you. We were taken prisoner[N]
in Vetheim and transferred here[N]
from Lord Cidor's manse a while back.[A][N]
Occasionally, he's stopped[N]
by and taken one of us[N]
further into the caves.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes]Those he took never came back[Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
If you have any spare[N]
healing staves or tomes,[A][N]
we would be happy to help you stop[N]
whatever madness he's planning.[A][X]

## Ch11_KwameGone
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Those voices in the darkness[Beat][AN]
Is that Cidor? Why is he here?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
And Kwame![A][X]

## Ch11_KwameGone2
[MidLeft][LoadAurora]
[Right][LoadCidor]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right]
Commander Aurora,[N]
remember your orders.[A][N]
You must stall these whelps[N][N]
for as long as you can.[A][N]
I must get back to[N]
Castle Selese at once.[A][N]
That is the only way[N]
our land can survive[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, Lord Cidor.[A][N]
As a general of Selese, I[N]
will do whatever I can for[N]
our land[Beat] for you.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Cidor[Beat][A][N]
Once I finish my tale,[N]
just what will you do[Beat]?[A][ClearFace]
[Right][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Something's not right here.[N]
That man he's holding prisoner,[N]
and how erratically he's acting[Beat][A][N]
I must survive this battle,[N]
so I can discover the truth.[A][N]
For my sister's sake[Beat][A][X]

## Ch11End_MainScene
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]

[MidRight][LoadSoldier][OneLineBox]
General Aurora is dead[Beat]![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
It's over. Soldiers of Selese,[N]
surrender your arms now and[N]
you can leave with your lives.[A]

Look here.[A][N]
On their commander's corpse,[N]
there's a map of the caverns.[A]
[MidRight]
So Cidor figured out that we[N]
were using the tunnels somehow[Beat][A][N]
There's no time to worry[N]
about how he knew that.[A][N]
We need to get to the end[N]
of the caves and find Kwame.[A]
[MidLeft]
We're almost at Castle Selese.[A][N]
Soon, the same dungeons[N]
that saw Dragana die[A][N]
will see Cidor meet the same[N]
fate on their cold stone.[A]
Soon[Beat][A][X]

Truly your intervention[N]
must be Byelen's doing.[A][N]
I'd imagine there are those[N]
among you who would be[N]
capable of using this.[A]
It's a staff that can only[N]
be used by those who have[N]
dedicated themselves to Byelen.[A][X]
