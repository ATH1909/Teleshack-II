[MidRight]
[Beat] What a mess this all is.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Tis an unfortunate development,[N]
but one we will need to work[N]
with, regardless.[A]
[MidRight]
You should've cut them down[N]
when you had the chance.[N]
They were in tatters. Exhausted.[AN]
You and I both know that your[N]
strength would've overwhelmed[N]
those pups easily.[A]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps so, but who would remain[N]
to rule Decia? This country has already[N]
suffered much hardship, Duke Cidor.[AN]
If it were to lose all of its[N]
leaders, the result would benefit[N]
no one. Not Decia nor Cythes.[AN]
This country would be naught[N]
but a pile of ash, steeped[N]
in chaos and anarchy.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Tell me then, Duke, how do[N]
you currently fare?[AN]
This has certainly been[N]
a setback.[A]
[MidRight]
The situation[Beat] is not[N]
looking promising for us.[AN]
Many perished during the fight[N]
for Castle Freyse, sadly.[AN]
Even your knights that accompanied[N]
us were no match.[AN]
In addition to these[Beat] difficulties[N]
it's grown difficult to keep order.[AN]
My subjects grow rowdier as[N]
the rebels gain momentum.[AN]
I fear that much of the country[N]
will grind to a halt if this persists.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] I see.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Well?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I've studied the geography of Decia.[N]
Castle Selese isn't far from Freyse.[N]
Perhaps you have an opportunity.[AN]
The most direct path the rebels[N]
wpuld need to take would be[N]
Raio Pass.[AN]
[MidRight]
Raio Pass[Beat][N]
You'd try to halt their[N]
advance there, Sir Elias?[A]
[MidLeft]
Exactly.[N]
The terrain would favor my[N]
troops particularly well.[AN]
I doubt the rebels[N]
would be able to beat[N]
us there, given our advantage.[AN]
[MidRight]
To stall them there would[N]
certainly give us time to prepare.[N]
However, they'd have time too.[AN]
More concerningly, House Freyse[N]
would also take notice of your[N]
men occupying such a key route.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Even if we do not defeat them[N]
ouright, we could stall them out[N]
long enough to make them weary.[AN]
[Beat] Perhaps then, the full strength[N]
of the Cythean Empire could assist[N]
in delivering the decisive blow.[A]
[MidRight]
That would certainly be welcome.[N]
That said, I will leave the[N]
forticiations to you.[AN]
For myself[Beat] I will[N]
return to my manse, for I[N]
have[Beat] business, to attend to.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Is that right?[N]
Things turn south and you suddenly[N]
have [OpenQuote]business" elsewhere?[AN]
It almost sounds as though[N]
you're choosing to flee[N]
just as you face adversity.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Do you take me for a coward?[N]
After all I've suffered and[N]
sacrificied to aid Cythes[Beat][AN]
You would stand here and levy[N]
such baseless claims in my[N]
face? I will not let this stand![A]
[MidLeft]
You'll have to forgive me[N]
for finding it suspicious.[N]
It's just[Beat][AN]
I don't think it unreasonable to[N]
assume the worst of one who sold out[N]
his own people to save his own hide.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hrngh[Beat] How dare you![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then tell me truly, Duke Cidor.[N]
Do you intend to flee?[A]
[MidRight]
I'd never dream of it.[N]
There is a relic in my manse.[AN]
One of your soldiers happened[N]
upon it. I thought you'd[Beat][AN]
perhaps find some use of[N]
such a rare artifact.[AN]
[MidLeft]
A relic, you say?[N]
This is the first I've heard of it.[A]
[MidRight]
Consider it a gift that may[N]
aid us all, Sir Elias.[AN]
Perhaps you should not treat[N]
your allies with so much skepticism.[AN]
Remember where you stand. I[N]
need no permission to do as I please.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hmph.[AN]
And you'd do well to remember[N]
where you stand, Duke Cidor.[AN]
Remember what all of us[N]
have to lose, here.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][X]

## Ch11Start_News
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I can't believe how far[N]
we've come.[AN]
But still[Beat][N]
So many obstacles remain.[AN]
Mother[Beat] Father[Beat] Dragana[Beat][AN]
[Beat]Count the flickers of the[N]
candle's flame Cidor.[AN]
Your time has come to an end.[A] 
[MidLeft][LoadSeleseF][TwoLineBox]
Commander Loewe, we followed[N]
Elias and Cidor until nightfall.[AN]
They're heading directly[N]
south from here,[A][N]
and flying over the countryside[N]
past the Selese border.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Thank you Onson.[AN]
You risked your life to[N]
bring us this information.[AN]
Go, get some rest.[AN]
We've got a long day[N]
ahead of us.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Elias must have[N]
let her follow.[AN]
His wyvern could easily escape[N]
my own's pursuit if he tried,[AN]
Even while carrying[N]
the added dead weight.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loewe! Have you been up here[N]
this entire time?[AN]
Surely you can't spend all evening[N]
brooding like this.[AN]
Dragana wanted us to[N]
work together,[AN]
not have one of us off sulking[N]
like a child.[A] 
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The scout I sent returned.[N]
Reportedly Cidor and Elias[AN]
are headed directly south.[AN]
We need to depart before they[N]
anticipate our arrival.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We can't even be sure where exactly[N]
they were heading.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Castle Selese is a safe bet.[AN]
It's Cidor's seat of power,[N]
so he'd likely flee there[N]
when all else is lost.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I must agree with Sir Loewe.[N]
Lady Cleo.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadKwame][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Every moment we spend here[N]
is a moment closer the Cytheans[N]
get to achieving their goals.[AN]
I know of an ancient, forbidden[N]
tunnel through the Tenet Caves.[A][N]
It connects to the dungeons of[N]
a Reclamation Wars guard tower[N]
just outside Castle Selese.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Going through these caves[N]
would be a risky gambit,[A][N]
but we could evade Cidor's[N]
soldiers in the countryside[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
With Radnitz's assistance and[N]
the momentum our cause has gained,[A][N]
the Liberators may now be the[N]
strongest army on Decian soil.[A][N]
If we travel through these caves,[A][N]
we will let no one and nothing[N]
stand between us and Cidor's end[Beat][A][N]
between us and Dragana's vengeance.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well.[A][N]
Kwame, can we trust you to[N]
guide us through these caves?[A]
[FarLeft]
Certainly.[A][N]
I'll need some time to refresh[N]
my memory of them, though[Beat][A][N]
I'll speak with[N]
you again tomorrow.[A][ClearFace]
[Left]
In that case, I will inform Lord[N]
Radnitz and our troops of the plan.[A][ClearFace]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadRadnitz]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[OpenLeft][LoadCleo]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, I suppose I have no[N]
choice but to wish you both luck.[AN]
Mounted troops will[N]
struggle down in caves,[A][N]
so I'll send some infantry from[N]
my personal guard to join you.[A][N]
Put them to good use.[A]
[Left]
Thank you, Lord Radnitz.[AN]
The next time you see us, it will[N]
be as Decian Liberators victorious.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]

[OpenRight][LoadMilo]
[OpenFarRight][LoadIchwep]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
So, I heard you folks got a problem[N]
with a Cythean infestation.[AN]
Well, guess what, Loewe, Cleo?[N]
It looks like you're in luck![AN]
See, I also have a problem[N]
with a Cythean infestation.[AN]
And a very big axe.[AN]
My name is Milo, and this[N]
here is my daughter, Ichwep-[AN]
[OpenFarRight][OneLineBox]
We're not related.[A]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
That's but a small detail in[N]
the grand scheme of things![A]
[OpenLeft]
It's a pleasure to make your[N]
acquaintance, Lady Ichwep, Sir Milo.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Likewise.[AN]
Radnitz already briefed[N]
you on the plan, right?[A]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Passing through the Tenet Caves?[AN]
That is[Beat] certainly[N]
an interesting decision.[A][N]
Everything I've heard says they're[N]
all collapsed tunnels and dead ends.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Our advisor has assured us that[N]
he knows a path to Castle Selese.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Anyway, we are glad to count new[N]
allies like you two among us.[A]
[Right]
Here's to a free Decia![A]
Once we topple Cidor, I'll take[N]
you to this pub back in Freyse[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]
Didn't you get us both banned[N]
from that pub for life?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Small details.[A][X]

## Ch11Start_RadnitzEpony
[OpenMidRight][LoadEpony][OpenMidLeft][LoadRadnitz]
[MidRight]
Milord, are you sure it's wise[N]
to lend the liberators your soldiers?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm? Why take such a sour[N]
tone with me, Epony?[AN]
Lending our fellow liberators[N]
strength is wise.[AN]
Ichwep and Milo are only two soldiers.[N]
Foot soldiers well-suited for the cave.[AN]
Our mounted cavalry can handle[N]
whatever comes our way above ground.[AN]
Would you truly question such a[N]
minor decision?[A]
[MidRight]
Hmph.[AN]
Let's not forget your station,[N]
Lord Radnitz.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hrngh[Beat] this is not[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Ha! When push comes to shove,[N]
everyone watches their own back.[AN]
Just remember what we both[N]
stand to lose, Lord Radnitz.[AN]
You wouldn't want Loewe and Cleo[N]
to snatch all the glory[Beat][AN]
Who is to say what would become[N]
of House Freyse then, hm?[A]

And that's when I went to the[N]
stablemaster and asked him,[A][N]
[OpenQuote]Hey buddy, why the long face?"[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Wahaha! That's a good one, Milo![A][N]
It's good to see people who[N]
can remain in such high spirits[N]
despite these troubling times.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And these troubling caves.[N]
They're one heck of a maze![A][N]
Why, if I didn't know better,[A][N]
I'd think that Ichwep would've[N]
gotten lost in them already.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed.[A][N]
We've spent so long down here[N]
that I've lost track of how[N]
much time has passed[Beat][A][N]
It must be my old[N]
age getting to me.[A]

Please, Commander Cleo,[A][N]
allow me to lead your pegasus[N]
through these corridors.[A][N]
I'm sure your attention would[N]
be better spent elsewhere.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
My apologies, Ichwep, but he[N]
is quite particular about[N]
who he lets handle hi-[A]
H-hey, don't go licking her![A][N]
[Beat]Very well. I suppose I[N]
should check in with Loewe.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Are you and your[N]
force holding up?[A]
[MidRight]
Aye. We're making good progress,[N]
and everyone's in high spirits.[A][N]
Milo especially looks like he's[N]
here for a party, not a war.[A]
[MidLeft]
It is nice to see everyone[N]
smiling for a change.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]We're so close to the end[Beat] to[N]
fulfilling Dragana's dream.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]Where's Kwame?[AN]
I thought he was out here,[N]
helping you forge a path.[A]
[MidRight]
He told me he went back[N]
to help your rearguard[Beat][A][N]
Kwame was here a minute ago.[N]
He couldn't have gotten too far.[A]
[MidLeft]
We need Kwame if we want to[N]
ever make it out of here.[A][N]
Let's split up and find him.[A][X]

Hah[Beat] hah[Beat] I'm not built for[N]
this sort of sprinting anymore.[A][N]
Now that I've gotten out of[N]
their sight, it should be[N]
just around this corner[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]No[Beat] Oh, no.[A] The seal[N]
I placed here, all those years[N]
ago[Beat] it's broken? Who[Beat]?[A]

Looking for something, Kwame?[A]
[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
D-Duke Cidor![A][N]
If you're down here,[N]
then that means[Beat]![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]That's right. I've[N]
a clue to just who[N]
you truly are, Kwame.[A][N]
I didn't want to[N]
believe it at first,[A][N]
but just seeing your[N]
face now gave it away.[A][N]
It's been decades, and yet[N]
you haven't aged a day[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]So you've figured it out.[N]
What do you want from me, Cidor?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm a dead man, Kwame.[A][N]
Why don't you come, and[N]
walk with me a moment?[A][N]
Walk with me, and tell me why[N]
I sacrificed the dignity of[N]
my friends and countrymen.[A][N]
Tell me the truth of why I let[N]
the empire devour the lives[N]
and livelihoods of Decia.[A][N]
Tell me the truth of why I gave up[N]
my daughter and my true love.[A][N]
Tell[.5] me[.5] the[.5] truth[.5] of[.5] this[.5] world![A][N]
[Beat]Refuse, and I'll take all that[N]
I've found straight to those two.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I see, Cidor.[A][N]
In that case,[N]
I'll tell you[Beat][A][N]
I'll tell you a tale,[N]
from long, long ago[Beat][A][X]

## Ch11Start_BadGuysAreHere
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Beat]It's no use.[N]
Kwame's trail ends here.[A][N]
It's almost as if he[N]
disappeared out of nowhere[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][LoadIchwep]
Lady Cleo, there are footsteps[N]
coming from all sides.[A][N]
Some of them are soldiers wearing[N]
the armor of Selese troops.[A]
[MidLeft]
But Kwame said Duke Cidor didn't[N]
know about these caves[Beat] unless[Beat]?[A][N]
[OpenEyes][Beat]It seems this place[N]
isn't so empty after all.[A][N]
We'll need to break through![A]

Thank you. We were taken prisoner[N]
in Vetheim and transferred here[N]
from Lord Cidor's manse a while back.[A][N]
Occasionally, he's stopped[N]
by and taken one of us[N]
further into the caves.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes]Those he took never came back[Beat][A]

Commander Aurora,[N]
remember your orders.[A][N]
You must stall these whelps[N][N]
for as long as you can.[A][N]
I must get back to[N]
Castle Selese at once.[A][N]
That is the only way[N]
our land can survive[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, Lord Cidor.[A][N]
As a general of Selese, I[N]

There's no time to worry[N]

We need to get to the end[N]

We're almost at Castle Selese.[A][N]
