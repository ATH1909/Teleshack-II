[MidLeft][LoadEllerey][ThreeLineBox]
Hey there, commander. Name's Ellerey.[N]
I know a thing or two about smithing.[N]
My weapon and armor are even self-made![AN]
I'd like to tag along with you, since[N]
I never did like what Cidor was up to.[A]
[MidRight]
An armored knight, huh? We've had a[N]
couple join us already, but none[N]
with a preference for the lance.[AN]
I'll give it some thought.[A][X]

Hey there, commander. Name's Ellerey.[N]
I know a thing or two about smithing.[N]
My weapon and armor are even self-made![AN]
I'd like to tag along with you, since[N]
I never did like what Cidor was up to.[A]
[MidRight]
An armored knight, huh? We don't have[N]
any with us right now, so your talents[N]
would stand out. Let me think it over.[A][X]

## EllereyPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Should I pick Ellerey?[No][X]

## EllereyAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadEllerey][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you so much, commander.[N]
I won't let this[N]
opportunity go to waste![A][X]

## EllereyRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadEllerey][ThreeLineBox]
I understand, sir. I'll hone my[N]
skills for our next encounter.[N]
Good luck out there.[A][X]

## MantouFirstTalkDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadMantou]
[MidRight]
You look like you have quite[N]
some experience with combat.[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course not, sir.
I am just a humble farmer.
[MidRight]
Not many farmers have blade[N]
wounds all over their arms.[A]
[MidLeft]
Those are from[Beat] angry foxes[N]
attacking the hen cage.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
And that bloodied, worn axe of yours?[A]
[MidLeft]
Had to slaughter the hens before I left.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
A likely story[Beat] but we need extra[N]
hands for this expedition, so long as[N]
they keep well Tippanyy from from our own.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
What's that supposed to mean?[A][X]

## MantouPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Should I pick Mantou?[No][X]

## MantouAcceptedDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadMantou]
I'm sure I'll do well on the[N]
battlefield! You won't regret this.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Better keep my good eye on this one[Beat][A][X]

## MantouRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadMantou]
Fine. I'll just return[N]
to my old line of work.[A][X]

## TippanyFirstTalkDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadTippany][OneLineBox]
Oh, um. Sir![A]
[MidRight]
At ease, miss. Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I am Tippany, sir! I am[Beat][N]
a curate. Of sorts.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
So you can heal wounds?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yes, sir! I also have some[Beat][N]
experience[Beat] with dark magic.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I see.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I used to, um[Beat] fall in with[Beat][N]
a bad crowd. But I want to help![AN]
And there's only so much[N]
I can do here in Decia[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Hmm[Beat][A][X]

## TippanyPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Should I pick Tippany?[No][X]

## TippanyAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadTippany]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
We'd love to have you, Tippany. I'll[N]
have the army prepare for you to join us.[A]
[MidLeft]
Oh, thank you, sir! I promise I'll[N]
do my best to keep everyone safe![A][X]

## TippanyRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadTippany]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
I appreciate your enthusiasm Tippany,[N]
but I'm not so sure about this.[AN]
If it means anything, I think there's[N]
still plenty that needs to be done here,[AN]
in Decia. We'll need good people to[N]
stay and protect our newly won freedom.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see[Beat] Well, either here or there,[N]
I'll do what I can to help! Although[N]
do let me know if you change your mind![A]
[MidRight]
Of course! Goodbye for now, Tippany.[A][X]

## PelecayeFirstTalkDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadPelecaye][ThreeLineBox]
Sir Loewe, I heard you may be traveling[N]
through the deserts of Mahemen. You see,[N]
I am in search of a certain plant.[AN]
I was wondering if I may join your ranks,[N]
as I have plenty of experience dealing[N]
with sand, so it won't slow me down.[AN]
I can even take a hit for frailer allies.[A][X]

## PelecayePickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Should I pick Pelecaye?[No][X]

## PelecayeAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadPelecaye][ThreeLineBox]
You won't regret this. Let me grab my[N]
plant encyclopedia so I can rejig[N]
my memory on what it looks like.[AN]
I'll be with you shortly.[A][X]

## PelecayeRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadPelecaye]
Very well. Perhaps Lord Radnitz[N]
will offer me employment instead.[A][X]

## CarlFirstTalkDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadCarl][ThreeLineBox]
You seek aid in your journey to Mahemen?[N]
Look no further, for I, Carl, offer you[N]
my assistance. As a fellow swordsman,[AN]
surely you can recognize that my[N]
swordsmanship, and my blade,[N]
are without equal.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Swordsman? You've got me wrong,[N]
my weapon of choice is the bow.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
An archer? But your stance, your[N]
movements, and that sword you[N]
carry with you[Beat] No matter,[AN]
I won't pry. So, what'll it be?[A][X]

## CarlPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Should I pick Carl?[No][X]

## CarlAcceptedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadCarl][OneLineBox]
My blade is at your service.[A][X]

## CarlRejectedDialogue
[MidLeft][LoadCarl]
The path of the blade[N]
is a solitary one[Beat][A][X]

## Ch12xTrajanLoeweEndingScene1
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
I've made my choices. I can only[N]
hope that I don't regret them.
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't worry so much. No matter what,[N]
I know you and Cleo can handle it.[AN]
That's why Dragana chose you two[N]
as her successors. Isn't that right?[A]
[MidRight]
I wonder. That kid, Tao[Beat] It's our[N]
fault that he turned out this way.[N]
If he ends up like me[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
No need to worry yourself over that.[N]
While I'm overseeing Selese territory,[N]
I'll keep an eye out for Tao.[AN]
He won't go down the wrong path.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thanks. Do you plan on giving the[N]
land to House Freyse, eventually?[N]
Dastard or no, Radnitz is still a noble.[AN]
[MidLeft]
After finding out what they've done?[N]
Not a chance. I was their knight once,[N]
but I left Joakim's service for a reason.[AN]
The old ways are done. We can't rely on[N]
nobles to do what's best for the people.[AN]
[MidRight]
You're right. With the Cytheans gone,[N]
we finally have a chance to change Decia.[N]
The people should have a say in who,[AN]
if anyone, rules over them[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
And that's what I'll make sure of.[N]
One more thing. With Dragana avenged,[N]
are you done with your vengeance?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No. Cidor may be dead, but Cythes[N]
still lives. For my parents, and my[N]
village[Beat] I cannot be satisfied,[AN]
not until Cythes crumbles at our feet.[A]
[MidLeft]
And what then? When their armies[N]
collapse, are you certain that[N]
will be the end of your rage?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Be careful with your vengeance, Loewe.[N]
It may not lead to the outcome you want.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'll keep that in mind, but for now,[N]
I need to finish preparations for our[N]
journey west. Take care, Trajan.[A][X]

## Ch12xTrajanLoeweEndingScene2
[MidRight][LoadLoewe][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]If I stop now, how could I ever[N]
face the fallen? They should[Beat] No,[AN]
they must be avenged. That's the only[N]
way I can shed this loathsome burden[Beat][N]
To earn my liberation.[A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene1
[Right][LoadRadnitz]
[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It seems the Liberators succeeded[Beat][N]
but what do they plan to do with[N]
Selese? Without an heir in sight,[AN]
might this meeting be their way of[N]
giving it to us? A united Decia[Beat][AN]
Cythes would stand little chance[N]
against all of us, working as one.[A]
[FarRight]
Perhaps, but there's no telling what[N]
the Liberators may do. We should obscure[N]
our hopes, for the time being.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Right. Let's just follow their lead.[A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene2
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadRadnitz]
[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[MidLeft]
Welcome, Lord Radnitz, Epony.[N]
It is good to see you arrived safely.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you, and congratulations on the[N]
victory, Cleo. It seems the work of[N]
the Liberators is finally done,[AN]
with Cythes pushed out of our borders.[A]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps, in the long term[Beat] We should[N]
continue the rest of this conversation[N]
in the castle, in case of prying ears.[A]
[Right]
Indeed. Lead the way, then.[A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene3
[MidLeft][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
The main entrance was damaged, so our[N]
only route into the castle lies under[N]
its earth. My apologies for the detour.[A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene4
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadEpony][ThreeLineBox]
Excuse me, but are you certain this[N]
is the right way? This is quite far from[N]
the entrance, and I see no one nearby.[AN]
And what of your partner? Does our[N]
arrival not warrant his presence?[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, this is the right place. As for[N]
Loewe, he need not concern himself[N]
with this matter. After all[Beat][AN]
I'll soon resolve it. Now, Kwame![AN]
[FarFarLeft][OneLineBox]
All troops, fire![A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene5
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadRadnitz]
[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[Right]
A trap? Damn you, Cleo! Do you[N]
mean to take control of all Decia?![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Better in our hands than yours.[N]
After all, you seem quite willing to[N]
sacrifice the people for your own ends.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
How did you find out?[N]
Was it Buldak? Iberis?![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That's none of your concern,[N]
seeing as you'll both die here![A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene6
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadRadnitz]
[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Wait! Cleo, please. We made a mistake,[N]
a big one, but if you let us leave,[N]
I'll abdicate the throne of Freyse.[AN]
We'll never show our faces here again.[N]
Please[Beat] just spare Epony's life![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is too late for regret. Even if[N]
you speak true, you stained our hands.[N]
All you would need to do is talk freely,[AN]
and everything we've built would fall[N]
to nothing[Beat] No, your only escape from[N]
here will be inside a bloody casket![AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
She won't listen to reason, Radnitz![N]
You need to run and-[A][X]


## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene8BuldakAlive
[MidLeft][LoadEpony]
You[Beat] I should have had you[N]
killed when I had the chance[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
We can't take back our mistakes, but[N]
I'm doing what I should've long ago![A][X]


## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene9
[MidLeft][LoadEpony]
[MidRight][LoadRadnitz][ThreeLineBox]
Epony? No, no, no, this[N]
can't be happening![N]
I can't do this on my own![AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sorry, Radnitz. Just run[Beat][N]
Leave me here and escape,[N]
for House Freyse's sake.[AN]
I[Beat] was happy to be with you,[N]
till the end[Beat] Live on, please![A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene10
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadRadnitz]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Good riddance. Do you have[N]
any parting words, Radnitz?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ha[Beat] Hahahaha! Yes, I do.[N]
I can see the writing on the wall.[N]
I won't be surviving on this day,[AN]
but neither will you, monster![A][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene10CleoBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[Beat]You still have[N]
some fight in you?[AN]
Fine, then.[N]
I'll kill you myself![AN][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene10RadnitzDeathQuote
[MidRight][LoadRadnitz]
Hell[Beat] my lance was shallow.[N]
Epony[Beat] I'm sorry.[AN]
I couldn't[Beat] avenge you[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene11
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
It's over[Beat] Now, the[N]
tough part begins. Kwame![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, Cleo?
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We need to control the flow of info[N]
if we want to keep our Freysian allies.[AN]
Gather the Selese prisoners that are[N]
slated for execution and add this to[N]
their charges. That should buy us time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Very well. I find it distasteful,[N]
but their deaths are guaranteed[N]
regardless. And what of Freyse itself?[AN]
[MidRight]
Send messengers there informing them of[N]
their deaths in a few days, along with[N]
a group of soldiers to guard the region.[AN]
Freysian soldiers, if possible.[N]
Their kinsmen should inspire trust.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Should we make plans for[N]
Iberis's execution as well?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, that's not necessary. Killing her[N]
would only add to any theories of[N]
foul play, so we'd best leave her be.[A]
[MidLeft]
Very well. You should hurry back to the[N]
base, before Loewe grows suspicious.[N]
We are risking much in hiding this,[AN]
and yet, you are certain of this path?[AN]
[MidRight]
More than certain. He's already been[N]
through enough, and I am loathe to stain[N]
his hands any more than they are already.[AN]
[Beat]Regardless, you're right. I'll leave[N]
the cleanup in your capable hands, Kwame.[AN][X]

## Ch12xRadnitzEndingScene12
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] if you knew, you would[N]
undoubtedly condemn my methods.[AN]
Even so, I cannot rest until every[N]
threat to the Liberators is destroyed.[AN]
This is Dragana's[Beat] No, this is my[N]
own justice. To protect that which[N]
gave me reason to live once more,[AN]
no matter the cost[Beat][A][X]
