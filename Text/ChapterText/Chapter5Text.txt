## Chapter5Title
Ch3: Like a Steamed Crab[X]

## SysTextOpening
After escaping from Selessian forces, Loewe, Cleo,[N]
and company head out to regroup.[N] 
While the loss of their leader, Dragana,[AN] 
leaves them all feeling empty,[N] 
they are not without hope.[N] 
Cleo and Loewe agree the best course of action[AN] 
is now to return to Elmhurst Island,[N] 
a small enclave off the coast of Decia,[N] 
where the liberation army plans their activities[AN] 
from the relative safety and obscurity[N]
of the sea caves. To get there,[N] 
they would need to find a boat[AN]
willing to take them there despite the risks…[AN]

## AtPort
[OpenLeft][LoadCleo][OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[OpenLeft]This is Port Neufchatel…[N]
It is a smaller port city, and should be[AN]
obscure enough for us to avoid detection.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Right.[N]
We’ve been running for days…[AN]
We should have a lead on Selesse.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Then let’s not squander[N]
this opportunity, Loewe.[AN]
We need to find a boat.[N]
Quickly.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Right, let’s split up and search.[N]
It’ll look less suspicious than our[AN]
traveling with a large group.[A][X]
[ClearCleo][ClearLoewe]


## SysTextMomentsLater
After searching for a boat...[AN][X]

## MeetingLongxia
[OpenLeft][LoadCle][OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
Any luck, Cleo?[N]
People are giving us suspicious looks.[AN]
I’m worried if we linger,[N]
they’ll send word to Selesse.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]None.[N]
No one is willing to transport a[AN]
group of our size.[N]
At least, not for a price we[AN]
can afford to pay.[N]
We may need to change plans[AN]
and take a land route.[A][X]
[OpenRight]A land route?[N]
I know you’re tired, too, Cleo,[AN]
but that would be insane![N]
We don’t know friend from foe[AN]
anymore. It’s too risky![A][X]
[OpenLeft]Loewe, I know you’re stressed,[N]
but we need to be prepared.[AN]
We should always have a contingency[N]
plan. That’s what Dragana taught us.[A][X]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]Dragana…[A][X]
[OpenFarFarRight]Oy! You lot still fancy[N]
a boat ride?[A][X]
[OpenFarRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenRight[ClearLoewe]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe]Hm? It’s you…[AN]
I asked you about a boat no more[N]
than ten minutes ago.[AN]
Why the change of heart?[N]
We can’t pay you.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]As it turns out, I have another[N]
passenger who is willing to pay.[AN]
He overheard you loudmouths and[N]
took pity on you, or so I’d guess.[AN]
Can’t see why else a traveler would[N]
Be willing to pony up that gold![A][X]
[OpenLeft]This could be fortuitous, but[N]
I am skeptical.[AN]
Who is willing to pay for us?[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]Beats me.[AN]
But if he’s paying, I’m happy to[N]
take you all on board.[AN]
I’m trying to shove off soon,[N]
So make a decision.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Not sure what other choice[N]
we have. Right, Cleo?[A][X]
[OpenLeft]It certainly beats any alternatives[N]
I can think of.[AN]
Thank you, Miss, for your help.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]You have some nice manners, girl.[AN]
Call me Longxia.[N]
Follow me.[A][X]


## BoatTalk

[OpenLeft][LoadCleo][OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
[OpenLeft]Loewe… how are you feeling?[A][X]
[OpenRight]Cleo…[AN]
I’m still thinking about[N]
What happened back there.[AN]
If only we were stronger…[N][CloseEyes]
If only we were faster…[AN]
Dragana might still be here.[AN][OpenEyes]
[OpenLeft]Dragana’s death weighs heavily[N]
on us all, Loewe.[AN]
However, she planned for this.[AN]
You and I will take joint charge of[N]
our remaining forces.[A][X]
[OpenRight]Let’s hope that two heads[N]
are actually better than one.[A][X]
[OpenFarFarRight]Two heads are better than one,[N]
but have you considered three?[A][X]
[OpenRight][ClearLoewe]
[OpenRight][LoadKwame][OpenFarRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[OpenLeft]So, you’re our mysterious patron.[N]
I am Cleo, and this is Loewe.[AN]
We appreciate your generosity[N]
in our hour of need.[A][X]
[OpenRight]You owe me no thanks, Lady Cleo,[N]
for it may be good fortune that we’ve met.[AN]
I can sense from your body language[N]
that you’ve lost someone dear to you.[AN]
Perhaps a friend or a mentor.[N]
Perhaps one who was both.[AN]
Am I wrong?[A][X]
[OpenLeft]...[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]... Yes, we have.[AN]
But what do you have to[N]
do with any of this?[A][X]
[OpenRight]I’ve deduced from your group[N]
and your demeanor that you are fleeing.[AN]
The Cytheans continue to take this country[N]
town by town, castle by castle.[AN]
Word of captured liberators escaping[N]
has galvanized those who dare resist,[AN]
but Decians are still weak and disorganized.[N]
The reach of the Cythean Empire grows ever farther.[AN]
From what I’ve heard, they continue to[N]
march through the deserts of Maheman as well.[AN]
I suppose it will only be a matter of time[N]
before the Cytheans claim all lands their own.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]Word on the seas is that[N]
they’re fixing to take the fight further south.[AN]
[OpenLeft]So conquering Decia and Maheman[N]
To establish footholds from both the east and west…[AN]
Is their plan to attack the[N] 
southernmost kingdom of Chouwouj?[A][X]
[OpenRight]Chouwouj?[AN] 
Sure, they have resources,[N]
But they are without a king.[AN]
The royal family perished before[N]
I was born. Or at least I was told by my mom.[AN]
They are just bands of warlords who[N]
Are carving territory for themselves.[AN]
What could the Cytheans want there?[A][X]
[OpenRight]... I have my suspicions, but it[N]
Is not my place to say.[AN]
Regardless, I have decided to stake[N]
my lot with you all henceforth.[AN]
That is why I paid for your safe passage.[AN]
[OpenFarRight](Paid upfront too! What a sap!)[A][X]
[OpenLeft]So, you knew we were the liberation[N]
army all along…[A][X]
[OpenRight]That’s right.[AN]
You certainly don’t take[N]
Great lengths to hide this.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Are you mocking us?[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Loewe, please.[N]
This isn’t the time.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]It all seems a bit suspect[AN]
that this guy shows up out of nowhere,[N]
seems to know the Cythean Empire’s plans,[AN]
and was willing to take us on a boat.[N]
Something smells fishy,[AN]
and it isn’t the sea water.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]That’s just Fangai steaming[N]
some supper for us.[AN]
A fresh catch of lobster.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]I’m sure that will be lovely, but[N]
this isn’t the time to discuss lobster.[AN]
I agree with Loewe’s concerns.[N]
Besides, you’ve yet to share your name.[A][X]
[OpenRight]Ah yes, pardon me.[N]
I have been quite rude.[AN]
You may call me… Kwame.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Kwame…[A][X]
[OpenLeft]So, Sir Kwame,[N]
how can we trust you?[AN]
While I suspect you are not[N]
with the Cytheans,[AN]
as they’ve been far more direct[N]
in their approach to dealing with us,[AN]
what is your aim?[A][X]
[OpenRight]Let’s say that the fee I’ve covered[N]
for your travel is also for my own.[AN]
I wish to travel with you, and seeing your[N]
organization, I think I can help.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]You can fight?[A][X]
[OpenRight]I much prefer the arts[N]
of strategy, tactics, and diplomacy.[AN]
Given your ranks, I’m sure I can[N]
be of service.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]... Very well.[N]
You may travel with us, Sir Kwame.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Are you serious, Cleo?[N]
We don’t know what he’s after.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]We don’t have much choice[N]
in the matter.[AN]
He’s clearly not with the Cytheans,[N]
which makes him a friend for now.[A][X]
[OpenRight]As sound a reason as any, Lady Cleo.[AN]
Sir Loewe, I’m sure that in time, you[N]
will come to trust me.[AN]
If there is one thing you can trust,[N]
it’s that if the Cytheans extend their reach,[AN]
Everyone across the continent of Orodreth[N]
will bend the knee to the Emperor.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Always doom and gloom[N]
with you soldier types.[AN]
Like most common folk ain’t bending[N]
and bowing to anyone holding a spear.[AN]
Come on, if you don’t like lobster,[N]
I’ll steam some clams for you.[AN]
The fruits of the sea, they call them.[AN]
Steam with a little butter, some white wine,[N]
and an onion… you’ll have nothing to worry about.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]Food does sound good…[N]
Thank you, Captain Longxia.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]Pay it no mind.[N]
We better eat soon. Fog’s rolling in.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]You know, it does feel a tad[N]
warmer all of the sudden.[A][X]
[OpenFarFarRight]Cap’n![N] 
We’re ‘bout To get boarded![AN]
The ocean’s boiling like a kettle![N]
They’re gonna steam us like a crab![A][X]

## Tension

[OpenFarRight]Fangai![AN]
Don’t let that lobster spoil.[N]
We’ll take care of this.[AN]
[OpenRight]I’ll tend to our supper below deck.[N]
You get your troops ready.[AN]
As long as they don’t damage our ship,[N]
We can make it out of this alive.[AN]
If we keep sailing towards the straits[N]
of Gibraltar, they won’t be able to pursue.[AN]
Their ships may be too large.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Alright.[N] 
Cleo! Get ready.[A][X]


## Enemy

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRiggan]
[OpenMidLeft]Ocean’s warming up and rain’s[N]
about to fall.[AN]
They’ll be blinded by the steam.[N]
That’s when we strike.[AN]
Those traitorous dastards aren’t[N]
Getting out of here alive.[AN]
And if we can’t do it…[N]
Those geysers will certainly finish ‘em.[AN]
Prepare to board them![AN][CloseEyes]
This will be the moment everyone[N]
remembers Riggan for.[AN]
I’ll be the hero of the Cythean[N]
Empire… Yes, me.[AN]
Mom… Shafaqat...[N]
will you be proud?[A][X][OpenEyes]

## PostPreps

[OpenFarLeft][LoadCleo][OpenLeft][LoadLoewe][OpenMidRight][LoadKwame]
[OpenMidRight]It looks like the Cythean navy is captained[N]
By a powerful mage.[AN]
It looks as they he seeks to create[N]
steam by warming the ocean[AN]
and mixing it with the falling rain.[N]
It’s a clever trick, but it won’t stop us.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Gods, it’s hot… We can take ‘em.[AN]
I can shoot ‘em down, but I still[N]
hesitate with my sword arm…[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]That blade…[AN]
Hrm, excuse me.[N]
Focus on keeping them at bay.[AN]
They will relent if we hold out long enough.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight][ClearKwame]
[OpenRight][LoadLongxia][OpenFarRight][LoadFangai]
[OpenRight]Allow us to fight as well.[AN]
Ain’t gonna let the dastards ruin[N]
my ship.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]I am Fangai, a traveling dark mage.[A][X]
[OpenRight]Surprised you still can call yourself[N]
that, considering you mostly just like to cook.[A][X]
[OpenFarRight]There’s nothing wrong with[N]
Being well-versed in a number of interests.[AN]
It’d do much to broaden your character[N]
If you cared about something else,[AN]
you know, beyond this damned boat and coin.[A][X]
[OpenRight]Pah![A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]... Thank you both, let’s go.[A][X]

---

## PostBattleBoss

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCleo]Their commander is down![N]
Let’s make a clean escape![A][X]

## PostBattleTime
[OpenMidLeft][LoadArai]Dang… the rain is stopping.[N]
They’ve held out better than expected.[AN]
Let’s pull back for now and wait for[N]
further instructions.[AN]
Decian Liberators… you’re only prolonging[N]
your demise…[A][X]

## Lore

[OpenLeft][LoadCleo][OpenFarLeft][LoadLoewe][OpenMidRight][LoadKwame]
[OpenFarLeft]Finally… we made it.[N]
Thanks for all your help.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Truth be told, your army did[N]
most of the heavy lifting.[AN]
I can wax poetic on the art[N]
of warfare all day,[AN]
but to fight in one[N]
is an entirely different skill.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]You never did tell us how[N]
you came to be so knowledgeable[AN]
in this area. It’s unusual, franky.[AN]
Usually only nobles and aristocrats[N]
have access to such an education.[AN]
Many of the military men and women[N]
we’ve worked with learned[AN]
through their harsh trials[N]
and the mentorship of others.[AN]
You seem to be of a different[N]
sort altogether.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Perceptive you are,[N]
young liberators.[AN]
I knew it would be wise[N]
to stake my lot with you all.[AN]
As for my education, some may[N]
say I was fortunate, and others[AN]
may say I was unlucky.[N]
It’s all a matter of perspective, really.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Speak straight with us, Kwame.[AN]
I tire of your riddles.[N]
What are your aims?[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]The same as yours.[N]
To restore peace to this land.[AN]
To end the Cytheans’ plot[N]
of continental conquest.[AN]
To save the world from[N]
ruin, dramatic as it may sound.[AN]
but this isn’t the Maheman opera,[N]
for we are on the stage of reality.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]So why are they doing this, then?[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Surely there’s more to their[N]
plot than mere conquest.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]Indeed.[AN] 
While their goals today may be shrouded in fog,[N]
perhaps history can be our guide.[AN]
May I share a tale with you two?[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]A history lesson?[N]
… Alright.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Please go on, Sir Kwame.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Very well, young liberators.[N]
Gather around, for a tale I will tell.[AN]
I ask you beg pardon if you know[N]
stories from the book of old lore,[AN]
for it is how I came upon this[N]
tale, and from where I will recite it.[AN]
[OpenLeft]The Book of Havarti?[AN]
It’s the most well-regarded account[N]
of the origin of the continent of Orodreth,[AN]
at least as we know it.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Havarti…[AN] 
He was a Maheman[N]
scribe who served the rulers of old.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Very good. You are both[N]
quite well-learned, it seems.[AN]
That should make this easier.[AN
Please, I implore you to take a seat.[N]
We may be here for a while.[AN]
Now then, where to begin.[N]
There are many beginnings, in fact.[AN]
But we must set the right context.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Just get on with it, please.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Do not be hasty, I am merely[N]
setting the mood.[AN]
While I’m lacking candlelight and[N]
melancholic strings,[AN]
the dim glow of the moon[N]
will set the tone just fine.[AN]
So…[AN]
The Cythean Empire as we know today[N]
was once far grander.[AN]
As humanity modernized, their great[N]
rulers fostered innovations.[AN]
Early emperors fostered development[N]
in agriculture, fishing, metallurgy,[AN]
alchemy, medicine, and other disciplines.[AN]
That supported vast population growth,[N]
making many men and women wealthy.[AN]
However, after centuries of unity,[AN]
unique cultures began to emerge[N]
throughout the corners of the empire,[AN]
and the descendents of once benevolent[N]
Rulers turned to malice and greed.[AN]
Indeed, change was rife in all regions.[AN]
Generations of rulers oppressed those[N]
from the regions of Decia, Maheman,[AN]
and Chouwouj, among others of Orodreth.[AN]
They slowly whittled away at their independence[N]
and gains from the benevolent rulers of old.[AN]
“Bestowed upon me,” Emperor Abalone IX[N]
Declared, “is the divine right that Byelen[AN]
Gave to me to rule this land.[N]
You will love me.[N]
You will fear me.[AN]
It was my line whose grace summoned[N]
Byelen unto this world,[AN]
and Orodreth prospered.[N]
In this hour, the land is mine.[AN] 
There is no one who could dare[N]
match my divine capability to rule.[AN]
So, my subjects, I beseech you to bow down,[N]
for your kneeling will continue you yield fruit.[AN]
Those who challenge me are doomed[N]
to perish and suffer eternally.”[AN]
You can imagine that this did not go[N]
over well with regional lords and nobles,[AN]
Whose egos had grown alongside[N]
their pocketbooks and armies.[A][X]


## Lore2

[OpenFarLeft]Abalone IX was the last emperor[N]
Of the old empire, was he not?[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]Correct, but do you know[N]
how he fell?[A][X]
[OpenLeft]History is often a messy[N]
Web of myth and half-truths,[AN]
but the Book of Havarti speaks[N]
of individual warriors and their weapons.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]You are as sharp as the[N]
blades that ended the empire, Miss Cleo.[AN]
Very good.[AN]
Yes, while maintaining a large empire[N]
undergoing social change is never easy.[AN]
The legends would tell you that it was[N]
due to the power of weapons blessed[AN]
by divinity itself.[AN]
There were four weapons Havarti[N]
spoke of in his text,[AN]
but he only knew of them through[N]
the word of others.[AN]
There was the bow of Chouwouj,[N]
the axe of Decia, the spear of Mahetman.[AN]
And the sword of the Cythean Empire.[N]
The sword of Abalone IX was the finest[N]
Weapon of them all,[AN]
But it was stolen and used against him.[N]
He fell in battle,[AN]
and the Cythean territories[N]
retreated to their current borders.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]So, do you suspect that the[N]
Empire wants to use these weapons once more?[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]But they are lost to time,[N]
even Havarti did not know their names,[AN]
Only stories of their might and power.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]I do not know, young liberators.[AN]
However, if the Cytheans aim to restore their[N]
great empire of old,[AN]
they will need the power of the old[N]
weapons to maintain their grip.[AN]
The weapons Havarti spoke of[N]
were gifted to regional lords by the Cytheans.[AN]
It only makes sense they’d seek to take[N]
back the items that ended their dominance.[AN]
[OpenFarLeft]The entire continent ruled[N]
by Cytheans… We can’t let that happen.[AN]
We all have the right to be[N]
free and live as we wish.[AN]
The ruled should have say[N]
in who rules them.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]If the Cytheans’ march continues[N]
unimpeded, we may be doomed.[AN]
House Selesse betrayed Decia.[AN]
The Kingdom of Chouwouj is without[N]
their ruler or central leadership,[AN]
and Mahetman forces slowly dwindle[N]
in a battle of attrition in the sand…[AN]
[OpenMidRight]That is why I am here[N]
with you all, now.[AN]
I do not wish for the restoration of[N]
the Great Cythean Empire.[AN]
For an Orodreth controlled only[N]
by the iron grip of the Cytheans[AN]
will be one that is bleak.[N]
We will never be truly free.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Freedom..[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]It is you, young liberators, who[N]
may be the only chance we have.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]We have little in manpower[N]
or resources.[AN]
We are fueled only by morale[N]
and a willingness to die for liberation.[AN]
… But we have to fight.[AN]
We have to find the weapons[N]
And end their tyranny.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]The weapons were lost to time,[N]
they may be destroyed.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]... We have to assume[N]
they survived.[AN]
It is the only way we can[N]
ensure victory.[AN]
At least based on what we know today…[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Right, we must regroup[N]
And plan our next course of action.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]I say we gather our[N]
forces and launch a counterattack.[AN]
If we can rid ourselves of Cidor,[N]
more Decians will join us.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]But it may be too soon to[N]
successfully stage such an attack.[AN]
We may want to travel to Chouwouj[N]
And warn them of what Kwame speaks,[AN]
or go to Maheman to learn more about[N]
these weapons…[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]There are many choices before[N]
you both, Sir Loewe and Lady Cleo.[AN]
I trust you will make the correct one.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Our choices…[AN]
You’ve given us much to think[N]
about, Kwame.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]We will take a few days to strategize.[AN]
First, let’s see how our forces[N]
are doing and regroup.[AN]
From there, we can properly[N]
Weigh our options.[A][X]
[OpenMidRight]A sound plan. You two should[N]
Get some rest.[A][X]
[OpenLeft]Very well. Goodnight, Sir Kwame.[A][X]
[OpenFarLeft]Liberation… this is bigger[N]
than just us…[A][X]
[OpenLeft][ClearCleo][OpenFarLeft][ClearLoewe]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]...[AN]
It’s better they don’t know[N]
how poor our chances are.[AN][OpenEyes]
They have yet to lose hope[N]
in the face of adversity.[AN]
Cleo… Loewe… how will you respond[N]
in the face of true despair?[AN]
Will your youthful optimism shine a light[N]
In these dark times,[AN]
or will it be doused by the power[N]
of the Cytheans?[AN]
We must all overcome difficult[N]
challenges to truly become great…[AN]
Hm? It’s been a while since[N]
I’ve heard that noise…[AN][CloseEyes]
“The Halaka Suhaja will glow[N]
like a flame when near[AN]
that which was blessed[N]
by the radiance of Byelen.[AN]
Accept the light, for it will shield[N]
you from darkness and despair.”[AN][OpenEyes]
If the legends are true…[N]
We may still have a chance.[AN]
I must avenge those who[N]
died for me…[AN]
I will end this.[A][X]
