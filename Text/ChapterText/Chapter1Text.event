Do you hear that, Alena? Looks like[N]
the fighting's gotten underway.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Seems so. Well, you know the score.[N]
The duke's paying us well for this[N]
job, so we'll have to earn our keep.[A]
[Right]
You got it, boss. A day's work in[N]
gold is waiting for us! Let's get[N]
this over with and hit the tavern.[A]
[FarRight]
Like I give a damn about that... Once[N]
I find Svet, we'll break out of here[N]
and leave that to fools like you two.[AN]
Though I suppose Cibor will hunt me[N]
down after that... what a nuisance.[A][X]

There's still a fight going on?[N]
Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]
send their best to save Dragana.[AN]        
Well, I'm not one of them anymore,[N]
so I don't need to hold back.[N]
If any of them meet my lance,[AN]
they won't live to regret it![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Iskra, I'm glad you're safe.[N]
Do you still have my sword?[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course I do. You entrusted it to[N]
me, so there's no way I'd lose it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't want your gratitude, Loewe.[N]
Just don't make another plan risky[N]
enough where you'd need to do this.[AN]
You could have died, you know that?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'll do what I must to free Dragana,[N]
so I can't promise to take less risks.[A]
[MidLeft]
You plan to repay the general[N]
for saving you by risking death?[AN]
Surely you realize she wouldn't[N]
want that after raising you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You're right, but the Vyrens have[N]
already taken too much from us.[N]
I... We can't lose anyone else.[A]
[MidLeft]
I agree, which is why you need to[N]
tell me that you won't die like a fool.[N]
Otherwise, I'm not giving the sword.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
...You know how to twist my arm.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Of course. I've learned[N]
that much over the years.[A]
[MidRight]
Fine, I won't take any unnecessary[N]
risks. Is that good enough for you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I suppose it'll do. Here, take it.[A]

[Event]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Finally! Feels good to have[N]
his back in my hands. Now, let's-[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold on. If you don't mind me asking...[N]
Can you teach me how to use a sword?[AN]
I want to be able to defend myself,[N]
even if I'm unable to use my magic.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm not much of a swordsman to begin[N]
with. My mother taught me a bit,[AN]
but I doubt I'd be able to pass[N]
on that knowledge to someone else.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I've seen you practicing on[N]
your own sometimes, though.[N]
You look pretty good to me.[A]
[MidRight]
Against practice dummies, sure. When[N]
I'm facing a real person with one,[N]
there's a... sense of hesitation.[AN]
Still, if you really want to learn,[N]
then I can show you a thing or two.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ha, I'm glad you agreed. Wouldn't[N]
want to twist your other arm too.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah, get moving. We've[N]
wasted enough time talking, Iskra.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Coarse as ever... I hope he's a[N]
bit nicer as a teacher, at least.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadEmil][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, uh, Adjutant Cleo! I just[N]
wanted to ask you something.[N]
It'll be quick, I promise.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
There's no need for a title. Emil, was[N]
it? Ask away, but please make it quick.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, is it true that you're a[N]
Vyren? The thing is, I am too.[A]
[MidLeft]
That I am. I didn't expect I'd meet[N]
another deserter. Where are you from?[A]
[MidRight]
Just a small town close to the[N]
border of Decia. What about you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I was born in Gechrysos.
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The capital? Wow, you[N]
must've been rich.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I cannot deny it. They used this wealth[N]
to give me an unparalleled education[N]
at the Military Academy of Gechrysos.[AN]
They meant to raise me as the perfect,[N]
honorable officer of the Vyren Empire,[N]
just as my elder brother was before me.[A]
[MidRight]
I'd bet you're from a military family,[N]
then. Y'know, a guy from one of those[N]
was the reason I signed up for this war.[AN]
I met the man in charge, Elias Argymos.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
R-Really? How did that happen?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One day, he came into my town looking[N]
for recruits. Looking at him was like[N]
seeing a hero from a Vyren fairytale.[AN]
The model Vyren soldier, fighting for his[N]
country... With a guy like that heading[N]
the occupation here, it had to be just.[A]
[MidLeft]
...And then you came here and saw the[N]
truth for your own eyes, as I did.[N]
That we were lied to, about everything.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah... I'd only trained for a week[N]
before I defected from my squad.[N]
They chased me down, but thankfully,[AN]
Mira and the recon unit saved me.[N]
How did you end up on this side?[A]
[MidLeft]
I received a commissioned position[N]
based off of my family name, mostly.[N]
For a time, I followed my orders,[AN]
but the guilt became too much to bear.[AN]
When I came across General Dragana,[N]
I surrendered immediately to her,[N]
expecting I'd soon meet an executioner.[AN]
Instead, she let me live. I mean to[N]
repay that mercy in any way that I can.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's all we can do now... Sorry, that[N]
ended up taking longer than I thought.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, we should continue the mission.[N]
However, it was helpful, discussing[N]
this with someone else who understands.[A]
[MidRight]
Agreed. Well, I'll go on ahead, Cleo.[N]
Maybe we can talk some other time![A][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Argymos... So Emil met my brother?[N]
If I continue on this path, then[N]
I may have to see him again soon...[A][X]

## SvetomirAlenaTalkCh1Text

[MidRight][LoadSvetomir][OneLineBox]
Alena?! What are you doing here? 
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I took on a job from Cidour to stop[N]
any escapees down here. I did it to-[A]
[MidRight]
So... it's finally come to this...[N]
Fine then, have at you, knave![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let me finish. I did it to break you[N]
out, moron. Besides, how are you going[N]
to fight me with just that staff?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
...I have my ways. Anyway, that's good.[N]
You wouldn't want to cross a holy man.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sure... Anyway, let's get out of here[N]
while the rebels distract the guards.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sorry, but I can't do that. Turns out[N]
their general is locked up in here,[N]
and they need someone to heal them.[AN]
I finally have the chance to help free[N]
our people, and I won't let it pass by.[A]
[MidLeft]
Come on, use your head. We lost years[N]
ago, when Duke Cidour waved the white[N]
flag and welcomed the Vyren Empire.[AN]
Joining up with the half-dead scraps[N]
of the Liberators is a death sentence![A]
[MidRight]
Can you say that you're satisfied[N]
running away from them for the rest[N]
of your life? You're a fugitive now.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Of course not. I don't enjoy seeing[N]
them in charge anymore than you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then join us! If any part of you wants[N]
to see this land freed from its chains,[N]
then please heed my words, Alena.[A]
[MidLeft]
You've resorted to begging? Well, you[N]
must really be serious... Alright,[N]
I get it. Even if this is stupid,[AN]
even if it means we're just going to[N]
die, to hell with it. I'm with you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Haha, I knew you'd see things my way![N]
Well then, milady, lead the way.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Still hiding behind me, eh Svet?[N]
I guess some things don't change...[N]
Fine then. I'll carve a path for you![A][X]


## LoeweFreedText
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
Loewe! I'm glad you're alright.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
They roughed me up a bit, but[N]
I'm doing alright. Where's Lumi?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Some members of the recon unit are[N]
watching over our mounts, so she's[N]
with them. Here, I brought you a bow.[A]
[MidRight]
Thanks. By the way, did you find out[N]
where Dragana is? The guards wouldn't[N]
say a word about it when I asked.[A]
[MidLeft]
From the few we've interrogated, she's[N]
deeper in the dungeons. I couldn't[N]
find her exact location, however.[A]
[MidRight]
Then we have to get a move on, fast.[N]
If it comes to it, we may need to leave[N]
behind some of our allies, as well.[N]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you saying? How are we[N]
supposed to continue on without them?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It would be difficult, but if we have[N]
no other choice, then [Red]at least the two[N]
of us have to live to see another day.[Red][AN]
Rescuing Dragana is our top priority,[N]
and we can't afford to fail, Cleo.[A]
[MidLeft]
It won't come to that. I'll make sure[N]
everyone else escapes before us.[N]
That way, no one will be captured.[A]
[MidRight]
I hope it does go that easily. Still,[N]
we have to be prepared for anything.[A][X]
