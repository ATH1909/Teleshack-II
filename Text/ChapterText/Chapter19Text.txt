[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Urghhh[Beat][A] where is it[Beat][AN]
My head hurts so much already[Beat][A]
[MidRight][LoadVolran]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh?[.] I didn't expect to see someone[N]
else here.[A] What brings you to such[N]
a forgotten ruin?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hold on[Beat][A] You talk[Beat] really fast[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I've been told.[.] Are you ok?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
My head feels like it's going to[N]
split, so[CloseEyes][Beat] not exactly.[AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes]I'm looking for my sword. If I get it[Beat][N]
I'll[Beat] I'll feel better.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Interesting[CloseEyes][Beat][N]
My friend found a sword earlier[AN]
Tones of red, well-worn, doesn't[N]
cooperate with most wielders?[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]![A] Kaiserschwert![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
That sounds like a yes to me.[.][N]
Alright, we should stick together[N]
until we find my friend.[AN]
I assume you didn't come here alone?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, I had allies with me.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Got it. Name's Volran, by the way.[AN]
I'd like to ask you about the link[N]
between this sword and your migraine,[N]
but I'll hold off on that for now.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Loewe. Thanks for helping me out.[A][X]

## Ch19_Cleo_Tara_Open1
[MidLeft][LoadTara]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I don't know why Volran thought splitting[N]
up in this place was a good idea,[AN]
but honestly, I'm more upset at myself[N]
for going along with it[A]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Loewe?[.] Hey, Loewe![AN]
Wherever you are, I can't leave[N]
until I find you![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh, hey![.] What's up?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Excuse me, but what's that sword[N]
you have there?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Come on, not even a 'hi' first?[AN]
Well, I found it lying around here,[N]
but if I'm being honest with you,[AN]
it doesn't seem that useful.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That looks like-[N]
[MoveMidRight]
Uh, that can't be good for-[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If I had to interpret your reaction,[N]
I'd say that this is probably more[N]
than some useless tomb sword.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]it's, uh[Beat] my ally's.[.] Only he can use it.[AN]
We need to return it immediately.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Need?[A] Er, sorry, I don't mean to pry.[AN]
[Beat]look, how about this?[.] I'll just tag[N]
along until we find him.[.] Then we'll give it back.[A][X]

## Ch19_Loewe_Volran_Open2

[MidLeft][LoadVolran][MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
So, how did you lose your sword?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Our group was split by a trap.[N]
I was[Beat] [CloseEyes]urgh[Beat][OpenEyes] separated.[AN]
When I came to, I[Beat][AN]
It was gone.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Then our best move is to reunite with[N]
your allies.[A] I'm here with a friend,[N]
but we split up to cover more ground.[AN]
It's possible that she's with your group[N]
already, but even if not, she'll help[N]
defend you until you're feeling alright.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What are you doing here anyway?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It's a hobby of ours.[AN]
Some of the knowledge you can find in[N]
places like this is irreplaceable![AN]
Hell, even here, we found documentation[N]
on the journey on a long-lost sword,[N]
more accurate than any common source![AN]
It's not every day that you find out[N]
that some deadend ruin could house an[N]
almost legendary blade of Cythes,[AN]
but the rarity makes the discovery[N]
all the sweeter.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[MoveMidRight]
[CloseEyes]Ow[Beat] I'm sorry[Beat][AN]
It sounds really interesting, but[N]
my head just[Beat] hurts too much to proc-[AN]
[OpenEyes]Wait, did you say Cythes?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's what I thought![AN]
A mythical blade from another continent,[N]
coming to rest here?[A] Of all places?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Well[Beat] we've been looking for that.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's convenient.[AN]
Let's continue to search for your group,[N]
but now we know we have a common goal.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] sorry, it's getting worse[Beat][AN]
Can we keep talking[Beat] to a minimum?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Sorry.[A][X]

## C19_Intro_Textbox
Tara must return Kaiserschwert to[N]
Loewe by [ToggleRed]Talk[ToggleRed]ing with him.[AN]
If this is not done by turn [ToggleRed]18[ToggleRed], Loewe's[N]
blessing will spell his end.[A][X]


## Ch19_Kaiserschwert_Talk

[MidLeft][LoadTara][MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yo, you Loewe?[A]

[MoveMidRight]
[Beat]Kaiserschwert![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Wow, he seems[Beat] excited.[AN]
Never ended up figuring out[N]
what Cleo meant by "needing" it.[A][X]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No[Beat]![A] I was[Beat][.][N]

Oh, the lance?[ToggleMouthMove][.4][ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well[Beat] I found it earlier in the cave.[AN]
There's some cool stuff lying around,[N]
maybe if you actually used your eyes for on-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]What're ya gonna do with it?[AN]
Last I checked, you don't use those.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[ToggleMouthMove][.5][ToggleMouthMove]Sell it, probably.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Oh.[ToggleMouthMove][.4][ToggleMouthMove][AN]
So there isn't some really cool person[N]
you know that you'd wanna give it to?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You're not exactly subtle.[N]
No thanks.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Pleeeeeeeease?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
No![A] I said I'm selling it![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
