/* ending scene: points to hit?

3) Cleo asks him about his disappearing
act; Loewe says that something was bugging
him, and that he needed to think it over
4) Loewe draws his sword and points it
at Kwame; Kwame is thrown off and asks
why he's doing this, as does Cleo
5) Loewe tells Cleo that Kwame's
still hiding things from them;
He tells her that during the voyage
back, he took a quick look at Kwame's
journal in a rare moment of him slipping up
6) In this journal, there were various
notes; one of them was tracking how
long the lifetime of each Seed was
7) The lifetime keeps decreasing, and
the last one was only 30 years;
Loewe demands that Kwame tell him
what the decreasing time means,
and what the ritual really does
8) Kwame spills his guts;
He tells Loewe that as a byproduct of the
cost for immortal souls ever increasing,
the time for the Seed's "blossom" grows shorter;
When Cythes's blessing wanes enough,
the Seed immediately dies, triggering their blessing
