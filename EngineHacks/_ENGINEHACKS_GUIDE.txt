The main things of note that you may need to edit:

Unit stuff

- Move Stars: You'll edit the table in TeleshackII/ThraciaASM/MoveStars/Installer.event.
Just enter in the macro your unit's character definition and what number of move stars
you want them to have (5 is the max). 5% per star change to get another action.

- Leadership Stars: In EngineHacks/ExternalHacks/LeadershipStars/LeadershipStars.event.
Just add the units in question to the LeadershipTable. Each star gives +3/+3 Hit/Avoid to
all of that unit's allies.

- Extra Growths: Con/Move growth rates, located in TeleshackII/ThraciaASM/ExtraGrowths.event.
Follow the syntax of the examples shown there.

- PCC: Pursuit Critical Coefficient, aka the multiplier to a follow-up attack's crit. 
In TeleshackII/ThraciaASM/PCC/Installer.event. By default, it's 1, but SetUnitPCC can be used to change that.

- Supports: Benefits given when two units are within X range (you can change it but I recommend 3 or more).
Located in TeleshackII/ThraciaASM/Support/Installer.even. A unit's support list indicates what benefits
they receive when a character with the ID in their list is within X range. Separating it like this allows
for one-way supports or for differing bonuses for each character.
Use SetUnitSupportList(charID,charSupportList) to set the list to the given charID.

- FE8 Battle Anims By Character: If you have a unit that doesn't have a F variant,
such as the majority of cav classes, you may want to give them the right animations
here. The readme details how to do this. Located in TeleshackII/FE8-Battle_Anims_By_Character

Item stuff

- Equippables: Equip items that give something (skills, stats, etc). 
Located in TeleshackII/Equip/Equipment.event. If you're doing anything complicated,
then you'll likely need specific help here, but basic equipment can be added here to
the EquipmentList. Adding it to the DefenseEquipmentList and OffenseEquipmentList indicate that item
also loses durability for every attack taken or attack made (still needs to be in EquipmentList).

Chapter stuff

- DismountMount: Located in TeleshackII/ThraciaASM/Dismount/Installer.event.
If you're adding a mounted unit, then you should add them to the MountAll and
DismountAll macros, following the way they're done there (; between MountUnit(charID), none at the end).
If your map has sections of the map that aren't intended to be mount/dismountable, then add those to
the UnacceptedMountDismountLocationEntryTable. Specify your chapterID, the top left coords of the area,
and the top right coords of the area. 

- ReworkForPrepScreenRightTopImage: Add to the table so your chapter displays
the correct number in preps. The example should show how to do it.

- ToggleDeploymentSwapping: Here primarily as a QoL feature.
You can add your own if you want to lock a unit to a chapter
but don't want them to be stuck in a specific position 
(you can also put them in a locked one if you want).
